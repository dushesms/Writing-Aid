This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.
The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.

Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?
This is a great place to start digging in to those questions, with data on the plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenues of several thousand films. request from IMDB. In order to minimize the impact, we're replacing it with a similar set of films and data fields from The Movie Database (TMDb)
You can port your existing kernels over with a bit of editing. This kernel offers functions and examples for doing so. You can also find a general introduction to the new format here.
The new dataset contains full credits for both the cast and the crew, rather than just the first three actors.
Actor and actresses are now listed in the order they appear in the credits. It's unclear what ordering the original dataset used; for the movies I spot checked it didn't line up with either the credits order or IMDB's stars order.
The revenues appear to be more current. For example, IMDB's figures for Avatar seem to be from 2010 and understate the film's global revenues by over $2 billion.
Some of the movies that we weren't able to port over (a couple of hundred) were just bad entries. For example, this IMDB entry has basically no accurate information at all. It lists Star Wars Episode VII as a documentary.
Data Source Transfer Details
Several of the new columns contain json. You can save a bit of time by porting the load data functions from this kernel.
Even in simple fields like runtime may not be consistent across versions. For example, previous dataset shows the duration for Avatar's extended cut while TMDB shows the time for the original version.
There's now a separate file containing the full credits for both the cast and crew.
All fields are filled out by users so don't expect them to agree on keywords, genres, ratings, or the like.
Your existing kernels will continue to render normally until they are re-run.

It has been of great use when teaching statistics to kids. With certain types you can also give a geeky introduction to machine learning.
This are the raw attributes that are used for calculating how much damage an attack will do in the games. This dataset is about the pokemon games (NOT pokemon cards or Pokemon Go).
The data as described by Myles O'Neill is:
#: ID for each pokemon
Name: Name of each pokemon
Type 1: Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks
Type 2: Some pokemon are dual type and have 2
Total: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is
HP: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting
Attack: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)
Defense: the base damage resistance against normal attacks
SP Atk: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)
SP Def: the base damage resistance against special attacks
Speed: determines which pokemon attacks first each round
The data for this table has been acquired from several different sites, including:
pokemon.com
pokemondb
bulbapeida
One question has been answered with this database: The type of a pokemon cannot be inferred only by it's Attack and Deffence. It would be worthy to find which two variables can define the type of a pokemon, if any. Two variables can be plotted in a 2D space, and used as an example for machine learning. This could mean the creation of a visual example any geeky Machine Learning class would love."

The first step in this journey was gathering some data to train a model. I plan to use deep learning to predict the wine variety using words in the description/review. The model still won't be able to taste the wine, but theoretically it could identify the wine based on a description that a sommelier could give. If anyone has any ideas on how to accomplish this, please post them!
Points: the number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1-100 (though they say they only post reviews for wines that score >=80)
Title: the title of the wine review, which often contains the vintage if you're interested in extracting that feature
Variety: the type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Pinot Noir)
Description: a few sentences from a sommelier describing the wine's taste, smell, look, feel, etc.
Country: the country that the wine is from
Province: the province or state that the wine is from
Region 1: the wine growing area in a province or state (ie Napa)
Region 2: sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank
Winery: the winery that made the wine
Designation: the vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from
Price: the cost for a bottle of the wine
Taster Name: name of the person who tasted and reviewed the wine
Taster Twitter Handle: Twitter handle for the person who tasted and reviewed the wine
Acknowledgements
The data was scraped from WineEnthusiast during the week of June 15th, 2017. The code for the scraper can be found here if you have any more specific questions about data collection that I didn't address.
UPDATE 11/24/2017 After feedback from users of the dataset I scraped the reviews again on November 22nd, 2017. This time around I collected the title of each review, which you can parse the year out of, the tasters name, and the taster's Twitter handle. This should also fix the duplicate entry issue.
Inspiration
I think that this dataset offers some great opportunities for sentiment analysis and other text related predictive models. My overall goal is to create a model that can identify the variety, winery, and location of a wine based on a description. If anyone has any ideas, breakthroughs, or other interesting insights/models please post them."

We are turning some of the data over to you so you can form your own view.
Even more than with other data sets that Kaggle has featured, there’s a huge amount of data cleaning and preparation that goes into putting together a long-time study of climate trends. Early data was collected by technicians using mercury thermometers, where any variation in the visit time impacted measurements. In the 1940s, the construction of airports caused many weather stations to be moved. In the 1980s, there was a move to electronic thermometers that are said to have a cooling bias.
Given this complexity, there are a range of organizations that collate climate trends data. The three most cited land and ocean temperature data sets are NOAA’s MLOST, NASA’s GISTEMP and the UK’s HadCrut.
We have repackaged the data from a newer compilation put together by the Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets (for example by country). They publish the source data and the code for the transformations they applied. They also use methods that allow weather observations from shorter time series to be included, meaning fewer observations need to be thrown away.
In this dataset, we have include several files:
Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures (GlobalTemperatures.csv):
Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures
LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius
LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average
LandMaxTemperature: global average maximum land temperature in celsius

The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.
The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.
What countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors contributing to happiness? How did country ranks or scores change between the 2015 and 2016 as well as the 2016 and 2017 reports? Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness?
What is Dystopia?
Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world’s least-happy people. The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key variables, thus allowing each sub-bar to be of positive width. The lowest scores observed for the six key variables, therefore, characterize Dystopia. Since life would be very unpleasant in a country with the world’s lowest incomes, lowest life expectancy, lowest generosity, most corruption, least freedom and least social support, it is referred to as “Dystopia,” in contrast to Utopia.
What are the residuals?
The residuals, or unexplained components, differ for each country, reflecting the extent to which the six variables either over- or under-explain average 2014-2016 life evaluations. These residuals have an average value of approximately zero over the whole set of countries. Figure 2.2 shows the average residual for each country when the equation in Table 2.1 is applied to average 2014- 2016 data for the six variables in that country. We combine these residuals with the estimate for life evaluations in Dystopia so that the combined bar will always have positive values. As can be seen in Figure 2.2, although some life evaluation residuals are quite large, occasionally exceeding one point on the scale from 0 to 10, they are always much smaller than the calculated value in Dystopia, where the average life is rated at 1.85 on the 0 to 10 scale.
What do the columns succeeding the Happiness Score(like Family, Generosity, etc.) describe?
The following columns: GDP per Capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, Trust Government Corruption describe the extent to which these factors contribute in evaluating the happiness in each country. The Dystopia Residual metric actually is the Dystopia Happiness Score(1.85) + the Residual value or the unexplained value for each country as stated in the previous answer.
If you add all these factors up, you get the happiness score so it might be un-reliable to model them to predict Happiness Scores.

Game of Thrones is a hit fantasy tv show based on the equally famous book series ""A Song of Fire and Ice"" by George RR Martin. The show is well known for its vastly complicated political landscape, large number of characters, and its frequent character deaths.
Data Sources
This dataset combines three sources of data, all of which are based on information from the book series.
Firstly, there is battles.csv which contains Chris Albon's ""The War of the Five Kings"" Dataset, which can be found here: https://github.com/chrisalbon/war_of_the_five_kings_dataset . Its a great collection of all of the battles in the series.
Secondly we have character-deaths.csv from Erin Pierce and Ben Kahle. This dataset was created as a part of their Bayesian Survival Analysis which can be found here: http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/03/bayesian-survival-analysis-for-game-of.html
Finally we have a more comprehensive character dataset with character-predictions.csv. This comes from the team at A Song of Ice and Data who scraped it from http://awoiaf.westeros.org/ . It also includes their predictions on which character will die, the methodology of which can be found here: https://got.show/machine-learning-algorithm-predicts-death-game-of-thrones
What insights about the complicated political landscape of this fantasy world can you find in this data?

(Or, at least, love in the first four minutes?) This dataset was compiled by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment.
Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute ""first date"" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information. See the Speed Dating Data Key document below for details.
For more analysis from Iyengar and Fisman, read Racial Preferences in Dating.
Data Exploration Ideas
What are the least desirable attributes in a male partner? Does this differ for female partners?
How important do people think attractiveness is in potential mate selection vs. its real impact?
Are shared interests more important than a shared racial background?
Can people accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market?
In terms of getting a second date, is it better to be someone's first speed date of the night or their last?"
Football Events,"More than 900,000 events from 9,074 football games across Europe",Alin Secareanu,256,"Version 1,2017-01-25",leisure activities,CSV,174 MB,Other,"49,559 views","9,488 downloads",89 kernels,5 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/secareanualin/football-events,"Context
Most publicly available football (soccer) statistics are limited to aggregated data such as Goals, Shots, Fouls, Cards. When assessing performance or building predictive models, this simple aggregation, without any context, can be misleading. For example, a team that produced 10 shots on target from long range has a lower chance of scoring than a club that produced the same amount of shots from inside the box. However, metrics derived from this simple count of shots will similarly asses the two teams.
A football game generates much more events and it is very important and interesting to take into account the context in which those events were generated. This dataset should keep sports analytics enthusiasts awake for long hours as the number of questions that can be asked is huge.
Content
This dataset is a result of a very tiresome effort of webscraping and integrating different data sources. The central element is the text commentary. All the events were derived by reverse engineering the text commentary, using regex. Using this, I was able to derive 11 types of events, as well as the main player and secondary player involved in those events and many other statistics. In case I've missed extracting some useful information, you are gladly invited to do so and share your findings. The dataset provides a granular view of 9,074 games, totaling 941,009 events from the biggest 5 European football (soccer) leagues: England, Spain, Germany, Italy, France from 2011/2012 season to 2016/2017 season as of 25.01.2017. There are games that have been played during these seasons for which I could not collect detailed data. Overall, over 90% of the played games during these seasons have event data.
The dataset is organized in 3 files:
events.csv contains event data about each game. Text commentary was scraped from: bbc.com, espn.com and onefootball.com
ginf.csv - contains metadata and market odds about each game. odds were collected from oddsportal.com
dictionary.txt contains a dictionary with the textual description of each categorical variable coded with integers
Past Research
I have used this data to:
create predictive models for football games in order to bet on football outcomes.
make visualizations about upcoming games
build expected goals models and compare players
Inspiration
There are tons of interesting questions a sports enthusiast can answer with this dataset. For example:
What is the value of a shot? Or what is the probability of a shot being a goal given it's location, shooter, league, assist method, gamestate, number of players on the pitch, time - known as expected goals (xG) models
When are teams more likely to score?
Which teams are the best or sloppiest at holding the lead?
Which teams or players make the best use of set pieces?
In which leagues is the referee more likely to give a card?
How do players compare when they shoot with their week foot versus strong foot? Or which players are ambidextrous?
Identify different styles of plays (shooting from long range vs shooting from the box, crossing the ball vs passing the ball, use of headers)
Which teams have a bias for attacking on a particular flank?
And many many more..."

Zillow's Economic Research Team collects, cleans and publishes housing and economic data from a variety of public and proprietary sources. Public property record data filed with local municipalities -- including deeds, property facts, parcel information and transactional histories -- forms the backbone of our data products, and is fleshed out with proprietary data derived from property listings and user behavior on Zillow.
The large majority of Zillow's aggregated housing market and economic data is made available for free download at zillow.com/data.

Variable Availability:
Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI): A smoothed seasonally adjusted measure of the median estimated home value across a given region and housing type. A dollar denominated alternative to repeat-sales indices. Find a more detailed methodology here: http://www.zillow.com/research/zhvi-methodology-6032/
Zillow Rent Index (ZRI): A smoothed seasonally adjusted measure of the median estimated market rate rent across a given region and housing type. A dollar denominated alternative to repeat-rent indices. Find a more detailed methodology here: http://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-rent-index-methodology-2393/
For-Sale Listing/Inventory Metrics: Zillow provides many variables capturing current and historical for-sale listings availability, generally from 2012 to current. These variables include median list prices and inventory counts, both by various property types. Variables capturing for-sale market competitiveness including share of listings with a price cut, median price cut size, age of inventory, and the days a listing spend on Zillow before the sale is final.
Home Sales Metrics: Zillow provides data on sold homes including median sale price by various housing types, sale counts (methodology here: http://www.zillow.com/research/home-sales-methodology-7733/), and a normalized view of sale volume referred to as turnover. The prevalence of foreclosures is also provided as ratio of the housing stock and the share of all sales in which the home was previously foreclosed upon.
For-Rent Listing Metrics: Zillow provides median rents prices and median rent price per square foot by property type and bedroom count.
Housing type definitions:
All Homes: Zillow defines all homes as single-family, condominium and co-operative homes with a county record. Unless specified, all series cover this segment of the housing stock.
Condo/Co-op: Condominium and co-operative homes.
Multifamily 5+ units: Units in buildings with 5 or more housing units, that are not a condominiums or co-ops.
Duplex/Triplex: Housing units in buildings with 2 or 3 housing units.
Tiers: By metro, we determine price tier cutoffs that divide the all homes housing stock into thirds using the full distribution of estimated home values. We then estimate real estate metrics within the property sets, Bottom, Middle, and Top, defined by these cutoffs. When reported at the national level, all Bottom Tier homes defined at the metro level are pooled together to form the national bottom tier. The same holds for Middle and Top Tier homes.
Regional Availability:
Zillow metrics are reported for common US geographies including Nation, State, Metro (2013 Census Defined CBSAs), County, City, ZIP code, and Neighborhood.
We provide a crosswalk between colloquial Zillow region names and federally defined region names and linking variables such as County FIPS codes and CBSA codes. Cities and Neighborhoods do not match standard jurisdictional boundaries. Zillow city boundaries reflect mailing address conventions and so are often visually similar to collections of ZIP codes. Zillow neighborhood boundaries can be found here.
Suppression Rules: To ensure reliability of reported values the Zillow Economic Research team applies suppression rules triggered by low sample sizes and excessive volatility. These rules are customized to the metric and region type and explain most missingness found in the provided datasets.

Things like Block chain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Ripple etc are constantly coming in the news articles I read. So I wanted to understand more about it and this post helped me get started. Once the basics are done, the DS guy sleeping inside me (always lazy.!) woke up and started raising questions like
How many such cryptocurrencies are there and what are their prices and valuations?
Why is there a sudden surge in the interest in recent days? Is it due to the increase in the price in the last few days? etc.
For getting answers to all these questions (and if possible to predict the future prices ;)), I started getting the data from coinmarketcap about the cryptocurrencies.
Now that we have the price data, I wanted to dig a little more about the factors affecting the price of coins. I started of with Bitcoin and there are quite a few parameters which affect the price of Bitcoin. Thanks to Blockchain Info, I was able to get quite a few parameters on once in two day basis.
This will help understand the other factors related to Bitcoin price and also help one make future predictions in a better way than just using the historical price.
]This dataset has features related to Ethereum. This is very similar to the bitcoin dataset and is available on a daily basis. Data is taken from Etherscan and the credits go to them for allowing us to use.

Inspiration
I've always been fascinated by TED Talks and the immense diversity of content that it provides for free. I was also thoroughly inspired by a TED Talk that visually explored TED Talks stats and I was motivated to do the same thing, albeit on a much less grander scale.
Some of the questions that can be answered with this dataset: 1. How is each TED Talk related to every other TED Talk? 2. Which are the most viewed and most favorited Talks of all time? Are they mostly the same? What does this tell us? 3. What kind of topics attract the maximum discussion and debate (in the form of comments)? 4.

education",CSV,60 MB,CC0,"42,504 views","4,267 downloads",19 kernels,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type,"Context
The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis:
Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E)
Intuition (N) – Sensing (S)
Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)
Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)
(More can be learned about what these mean here)
So for example, someone who prefers introversion, intuition, thinking and perceiving would be labelled an INTP in the MBTI system, and there are lots of personality based components that would model or describe this person’s preferences or behaviour based on the label.
It is one of, if not the, the most popular personality test in the world. It is used in businesses, online, for fun, for research and lots more. A simple google search reveals all of the different ways the test has been used over time. It’s safe to say that this test is still very relevant in the world in terms of its use.
From scientific or psychological perspective it is based on the work done on cognitive functions by Carl Jung i.e. Jungian Typology. This was a model of 8 distinct functions, thought processes or ways of thinking that were suggested to be present in the mind. Later this work was transformed into several different personality systems to make it more accessible, the most popular of which is of course the MBTI.
Recently, its use/validity has come into question because of unreliability in experiments surrounding it, among other reasons. But it is still clung to as being a very useful tool in a lot of areas, and the purpose of this dataset is to help see if any patterns can be detected in specific types and their style of writing, which overall explores the validity of the test in analysing, predicting or categorising behaviour.

Ranking universities is a difficult, political, and controversial practice. There are hundreds of different national and international university ranking systems, many of which disagree with each other. This dataset contains three global university rankings from very different places.
University Ranking Data
The Times Higher Education World University Ranking is widely regarded as one of the most influential and widely observed university measures. Founded in the United Kingdom in 2010, it has been criticized for its commercialization and for undermining non-English-instructing institutions.
The Academic Ranking of World Universities, also known as the Shanghai Ranking, is an equally influential ranking. It was founded in China in 2003 and has been criticized for focusing on raw research power and for undermining humanities and quality of instruction.
The Center for World University Rankings, is a less well know listing that comes from Saudi Arabia, it was founded in 2012.
How do these rankings compare to each other?
Are the various criticisms levied against these rankings fair or not?
How does your alma mater fare against the world?
Supplementary Data
To further extend your analyses, we've also included two sets of supplementary data.
The first of these is a set of data on educational attainment around the world. It comes from The World Data Bank and comprises information from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and the Barro-Lee Dataset. How does national educational attainment relate to the quality of each nation's universities?
The second supplementary dataset contains information about public and private direct expenditure on education across nations. This data comes from the National Center for Education Statistics. It represents expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product. Does spending more on education lead to better international university rankings?"

Gender Recognition by Voice,Identify a voice as male or female,Kory Becker,210,"Version 1,2016-08-26","scientific development
education",CSV,1 MB,CC4,"83,213 views","8,458 downloads",393 kernels,6 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender,"Gender Recognition by Voice and Speech Analysis
This database was created to identify a voice as male or female, based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in R using the seewave and tuneR packages, with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz (human vocal range).
The Dataset
The following acoustic properties of each voice are measured and included within the CSV:
meanfreq: mean frequency (in kHz)
sd: standard deviation of frequency
median: median frequency (in kHz)
Q25: first quantile (in kHz)
Q75: third quantile (in kHz)
IQR: interquantile range (in kHz)
skew: skewness (see note in specprop description)
kurt: kurtosis (see note in specprop description)
sp.ent: spectral entropy
sfm: spectral flatness
mode: mode frequency
centroid: frequency centroid (see specprop)
peakf: peak frequency (frequency with highest energy)
meanfun: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
minfun: minimum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
maxfun: maximum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
meandom: average of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
mindom: minimum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
maxdom: maximum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
dfrange: range of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
modindx: modulation index. Calculated as the accumulated absolute difference between adjacent measurements of fundamental frequencies divided by the frequency range
Research Questions
An original analysis of the data-set can be found in the following article:
Identifying the Gender of a Voice using Machine Learning
The best model achieves 99% accuracy on the test set. According to a CART model, it appears that looking at the mean fundamental frequency might be enough to accurately classify a voice. However, some male voices use a higher frequency, even though their resonance differs from female voices, and may be incorrectly classified as female. To the human ear, there is apparently more than simple frequency, that determines a voice's gender. What other features differ between male and female voices?
Can we find a difference in resonance between male and female voices?
Can we identify falsetto from regular voices? (separate data-set likely needed for this)
Are there other interesting features in the data?
CART Diagram
Mean fundamental frequency appears to be an indicator of voice gender, with a threshold of 140hz separating male from female classifications.

H-1B visas are a category of employment-based, non-immigrant visas for temporary foreign workers in the United States. For a foreign national to apply for H1-B visa, a US employer must offer them a job and submit a petition for a H-1B visa to the US immigration department. This is also the most common visa status applied for and held by international students once they complete college or higher education and begin working in a full-time position.
The following articles contain more information about the H-1B visa process:

The TLC's correspondence with FiveThirtyEight is included in the files TLC_letter.pdf, TLC_letter2.pdf and TLC_letter3.pdf. TLC records requests can be made here.
This data was used for four FiveThirtyEight stories: Uber Is Serving New York’s Outer Boroughs More Than Taxis Are, Public Transit Should Be Uber’s New Best Friend, Uber Is Taking Millions Of Manhattan Rides Away From Taxis, and Is Uber Making NYC Rush-Hour Traffic Worse?.
The dataset contains, roughly, four groups of files:
Uber trip data from 2014 (April - September), separated by month, with detailed location information
Uber trip data from 2015 (January - June), with less fine-grained location information
non-Uber FHV (For-Hire Vehicle) trips. The trip information varies by company, but can include day of trip, time of trip, pickup location, driver's for-hire license number, and vehicle's for-hire license number.
aggregate ride and vehicle statistics for all FHV companies (and, occasionally, for taxi companies)"

There are (ostensibly) no genuine, reliable, or trustworthy news sources represented in this dataset (so far), so don't trust anything you read.
Fake news in the news
For inspiration, I've included some (presumably non-fake) recent stories covering fake news in the news. This is a sensitive, nuanced topic and if there are other resources you'd like to see included here, please leave a suggestion. From defining fake, biased, and misleading news in the first place to deciding how to take action (a blacklist is not a good answer), there's a lot of information to consider beyond what can be neatly arranged in a CSV file.

This mortality dataset is a record of every death in the country for 2005 through 2015, including detailed information about causes of death and the demographic background of the deceased.
It's been said that ""statistics are human beings with the tears wiped off."" This is especially true with this dataset. Each death record represents somebody's loved one, often connected with a lifetime of memories and sometimes tragically too short.
Putting the sensitive nature of the topic aside, analyzing mortality data is essential to understanding the complex circumstances of death across the country. The US Government uses this data to determine life expectancy and understand how death in the U.S. differs from the rest of the world. Whether you’re looking for macro trends or analyzing unique circumstances, we challenge you to use this dataset to find your own answers to one of life’s great mysteries.
Overview
This dataset is a collection of CSV files each containing one year's worth of data and paired JSON files containing the code mappings, plus an ICD 10 code set. The CSVs were reformatted from their original fixed-width file formats using information extracted from the CDC's PDF manuals using this script. Please note that this process may have introduced errors as the text extracted from the pdf is not a perfect match. If you have any questions or find errors in the preparation process, please leave a note in the forums. We hope to publish additional years of data using this method soon.
A more detailed overview of the data can be found here. You'll find that the fields are consistent within this time window, but some of data codes change every few years. For example, the 113_cause_recode entry 069 only covers ICD codes (I10,I12) in 2005, but by 2015 it covers (I10,I12,I15). When I post data from years prior to 2005, expect some of the fields themselves to change as well.
All data comes from the CDC’s National Vital Statistics Systems, with the exception of the Icd10Code, which are sourced from the World Health Organization.
Project ideas
The CDC's mortality data was the basis of a widely publicized paper, by Anne Case and Nobel prize winner Angus Deaton, arguing that middle-aged whites are dying at elevated rates. One of the criticisms against the paper is that it failed to properly account for the exact ages within the broad bins available through the CDC's WONDER tool. What do these results look like with exact/not-binned age data?
Similarly, how sensitive are the mortality trends being discussed in the news to the choice of bin-widths?
As noted above, the data preparation process could have introduced errors. Can you find any discrepancies compared to the aggregate metrics on WONDER? If so, please let me know in the forums!
WONDER is cited in numerous economics, sociology, and public health research papers. Can you find any papers whose conclusions would be altered if they used the exact data available here rather than binned data from Wonder?
Differences from the first version of the dataset
This version of the dataset was prepared in a completely different many. This has allowed us to provide a much larger volume of data and ensure that codes are available for every field.
We've replaced the batch of sql files with a single JSON per year. Kaggle's platform currently offer's better support for JSON files, and this keeps the number of files manageable.
A tutorial kernel providing a quick introduction to the new format is available here.
Lastly, I apologize if the transition has interrupted anyone's work! If need be, you can still download v1."

Heartbeat Sounds,Classifying heartbeat anomalies from stethoscope audio,Ed King,161,"Version 1,2016-11-27",scientific development,CSV,152 MB,CC0,"36,595 views","3,376 downloads",32 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/kinguistics/heartbeat-sounds,"Here's a brief overview of the format of this dataset as uploaded to Kaggle. For a more detailed description, look at the Description section below.
The dataset is split into two sources, A and B: A was collected from the general public via an iPhone app, and B was collected from a clinical trial in hospitals using a digital stethoscope.
The goal of the task is to first (1) identify the locations of heart sounds from the audio, and (2) to classify the heart sounds into one of several categories (normal v. various non-normal heartbeat sounds).
The CSV files provided are: set_a.csv
set_b.csv set_a_timing.csv
The fields for set_a and set_b are as follows:
dataset: a or b
fname: the audio file
label: either ""normal"", blank (for unlabelled data), or one of various categories of abnormal heartbeats
sublabel: in set_b, some recordings are categorized as noisy, meaning they contain non-heart background noise; this field holds information on whether something is e.g. ""noisynormal"" or ""noisymurmur""
The file set_a_timing.csv contains gold-standard timing information for the ""normal"" recordings from Set A. This file contains the following fields:
fname: the audio file
cycle: anywhere from 1 to 19; the heartbeat cycle that the time observation refers to
sound: either S1 or S2; see below for what these mean
location: the time location of this sound, in audio samples
Description
The task, as described by the original authors
Task Overview
Data has been gathered from two sources: (A) from the general public via the iStethoscope Pro iPhone app, provided in Dataset A, and (B) from a clinic trial in hospitals using the digital stethoscope DigiScope, provided in Dataset B.
CHALLENGE 1 - Heart Sound Segmentation
The first challenge is to produce a method that can locate S1(lub) and S2(dub) sounds within audio data, segmenting the Normal audio files in both datasets. To enable your machine learning method to learn we provide the exact location of S1 and S2 sounds for some of the audio files. You need to use them to identify and locate the S1 and S2 sounds of all the heartbeats in the unlabelled group. The locations of sounds are measured in audio samples for better precision. Your method must use the same unit.
CHALLENGE 2 - Heart Sound Classification
The task is to produce a method that can classify real heart audio (also known as “beat classification”) into one of four categories for Dataset AYou may tackle either or both of these challenges. If you can solve the first challenge, the second will be considerably easier! The winner of each challenge will be the method best able to segment and/or classify two sets of unlabelled data into the correct categories after training on both datasets provided below.
[Obviously no longer applicable -- ed.]: The creator of the winning method will receive a WiFi 32Gb iPad as the prize, awarded at a workshop at AISTATS 2012.
The audio files are of varying lengths, between 1 second and 30 seconds (some have been clipped to reduce excessive noise and provide the salient fragment of the sound). Most information in heart sounds is contained in the low frequency components, with noise in the higher frequencies. It is common to apply a low-pass filter at 195 Hz. Fast Fourier transforms are also likely to provide useful information about volume and frequency over time. More domain-specific knowledge about the difference between the categories of sounds is provided below.
Normal Category
In the Normal category there are normal, healthy heart sounds. These may contain noise in the final second of the recording as the device is removed from the body. They may contain a variety of background noises (from traffic to radios). They may also contain occasional random noise corresponding to breathing, or brushing the microphone against clothing or skin. A normal heart sound has a clear “lub dub, lub dub” pattern, with the time from “lub” to “dub” shorter than the time from “dub” to the next “lub” (when the heart rate is less than 140 beats per minute). Note the temporal description of “lub” and “dub” locations over time in the following illustration:
…lub……….dub……………. lub……….dub……………. lub……….dub……………. lub……….dub…
In medicine we call the lub sound ""S1"" and the dub sound ""S2"". Most normal heart rates at rest will be between about 60 and 100 beats (‘lub dub’s) per minute. However, note that since the data may have been collected from children or adults in calm or excited states, the heart rates in the data may vary from 40 to 140 beats or higher per minute. Dataset B also contains noisy_normal data - normal data which includes a substantial amount of background noise or distortion. You may choose to use this or ignore it, however the test set will include some equally noisy examples.
Murmur Category
Heart murmurs sound as though there is a “whooshing, roaring, rumbling, or turbulent fluid” noise in one of two temporal locations: (1) between “lub” and “dub”, or (2) between “dub” and “lub”. They can be a symptom of many heart disorders, some serious. There will still be a “lub” and a “dub”. One of the things that confuses non-medically trained people is that murmurs happen between lub and dub or between dub and lub; not on lub and not on dub. Below, you can find an asterisk* at the locations a murmur may be.
…lub..*...dub……………. lub..*..dub ……………. lub..*..dub ……………. lub..*..dub … or …lub……….dub…*….lub………. dub…*….lub ………. dub…**….lub ……….dub…
Dataset B also contains noisy_murmur data - murmur data which includes a substantial amount of background noise or distortion. You may choose to use this or ignore it, however the test set will include some equally noisy examples
Extra Heart Sound Category (Dataset A)
Extra heart sounds can be identified because there is an additional sound, e.g. a “lub-lub dub” or a “lub dub-dub”. An extra heart sound may not be a sign of disease. However, in some situations it is an important sign of disease, which if detected early could help a person. The extra heart sound is important to be able to detect as it cannot be detected by ultrasound very well. Below, note the temporal description of the extra heart sounds:
…lub.lub……….dub………..………. lub. lub……….dub…………….lub.lub……..…….dub……. or …lub………. dub.dub………………….lub.……….dub.dub………………….lub……..…….dub. dub……
Artifact Category (Dataset A)
In the Artifact category there are a wide range of different sounds, including feedback squeals and echoes, speech, music and noise. There are usually no discernable heart sounds, and thus little or no temporal periodicity at frequencies below 195 Hz. This category is the most different from the others. It is important to be able to distinguish this category from the other three categories, so that someone gathering the data can be instructed to try again.
Extrasystole Category (Dataset B)
Extrasystole sounds may appear occasionally and can be identified because there is a heart sound that is out of rhythm involving extra or skipped heartbeats, e.g. a “lub-lub dub” or a “lub dub-dub”. (This is not the same as an extra heart sound as the event is not regularly occuring.) An extrasystole may not be a sign of disease. It can happen normally in an adult and can be very common in children. However, in some situations extrasystoles can be caused by heart diseases. If these diseases are detected earlier, then treatment is likely to be more effective. Below, note the temporal description of the extra heart sounds: …........lub……….dub………..………. lub. ………..……….dub…………….lub.lub……..…….dub……. or …lub………. dub......………………….lub.…………………dub.dub………………….lub……..…….dub.……

Context
I have been recording available different types of data on soccer matches since 2012, live 24/7. The whole database contains more than 350,000 soccer matches held all around the world from over 27,000 teams of more than 180 countries. An all-in-one package including servers, algorithms and its database are now under the ""Analyst Masters"" research platform. The app is also free for everyone to get its predictions on Android Play Store . How could it become useful for a data scientist?
Did you know that,
more than 1000 soccer matches are played in a week?
the average profit of the stock market from its beginning to now has been less than 10% a year? but you can earn at least 10% on a single match in 2 hours and get your profit in cash
It is one of the very rare datasets that you do not need to prove to other companies your method is the most accurate one and get the prize :) . On the other hand you do not have to classify every data point to be rewarded. Just tune or focus to correctly classify only 1% of matches and there you go! Let me give you a simple hint how easily it can become a classification problem rather than a time series prediction:
Example 1: Who wins based on the number of wins in a head 2 head history?
Q) Consider two teams Midtjylland and Randers from Denmark. They have played against each other for very long time. Midtjyland has won Randers over 8 times in the past 10 matches in a 4 year time span. Forget any other complicated algorithm and simply predict who wins this match?
A) That is easy! However, I am also gathering a lot more information than just their history. You can check their head-to-head history and the odds you could get for predicting this match is ""1.73"" check here.
Example 2: Number of Goals based on their history?
Q) Consider two teams ""San Martin S.J."" and ""Rosario Central"" from Argentina. Their odds for wining ""Team 1 (Home)"", ""Draw"" and ""Team 2 (away)"" is [3.16, 3.2, 2.25] respectively. They rank 22 and 13 in their league. They have recently won 45%,35% of their matches in their past 14 matches. Their average head to head goals in their last 7 matches were 1.3 full time (F) and 0.3 until half-time (HT). How many goals do you think they score in their match? (Note that a safe side of number of goals in soccer betting is Over 0.5 goals in HT, Under 1.5 goals in HT, Over 1.5 goals in FT and Under 3.5 goals in FT). Which one do you choose?
A) For sure under 1.5 goals in HT (you get 35%) and under 3.5 goals in FT (you get 30%) . Bingo you get 65% in a single match in 2 hours
Example 3: Based on the money placed for betting on teams who wins the match?
Q) ""Memmingen"" and ""Munich 1860"" are well known in Germany. One of our reliable sources of data is the ratio of money placed on betting from 10 hours before the match until it starts. Assume that the ratio of bets on ""Munich 1860"" to ""Memmingen"" are recorded every hour as below, which team do you think will win?
[bets in $ on Munich 1860]/[bets in $ on Memmingen] : {1.01, 1.02, 1.04, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.58, 2.3, 2.6, 2.8}
A) in 10 hours the amount of money placed on wining Munich 1860 Vs Memmingen increased from 1.01 to 2.8, who is the winner? Easy again, Munich 1860 that gives you 160% as stated here.
Try the dataset and inspect every strategy you may come up with, as I gave you three reliable examples above. Just perform well enough to predict 15 matches correctly in a row, start with $1000 and you are a millionaire. If you can't be that accurate use the Kelly Criterion to divide your whole money into smaller stakes.
Let me do the math for you, if you can only get 90% accuracy on 1% of data points (10 out of 1000 matches a week) and your average profit on each match is only 20%. You earn (9*20% = 180%) and lose 100% for your error in 10 predictions. Your net profit would be 80% in a week or approximately 12% in a day. if you risk only 33% of your whole money on each match then the daily net profit becomes 4%. I guess you can easily calculate how fast you can progress @ 4% daily accumulative profit.
For sure one needs a live data feed to predict the outcome before the match. If everything goes well and enough users are interested I will open the live feed of data for you in a shared folder of Dropbox saved in CSV.

It was inspired by the Dota 2 Matches data published here by Joe Ramir. This is an update and improved version of that dataset. I have kept the same image and a similar title.
Dota 2 is a popular MOBA available as free to play, and can take up thousands of hours of your life. The number of games in this dataset are played about every hour. If you like the data there are an additional 2-3 million matches easily available for download.
The aim of this dataset is to enable the exploration of player behavior, skill estimation, or anything you find interesting. The intent is to create an accessible, and easy to use resource, which can be expanded and modified if needed. As such I am open to a wide variety of suggestions as to what additions or changes to make.
Help getting started
If there is some aspect of this data you would like to explore but seems difficult to get figure out how to work with please feel free to request some starter code in one of the following two Kernels discussion section. I usually check kaggle every day or so. If you post a request about the current data I will try to get something working.
Whats Currently Available
I have found a few undocumented areas in the data, including the objectives information. player_slot can be used to combine most of the data, and it is available in most of the tables. Additionally all tables include match_id, and some have account_id to make it easier to look at an individual players matches. match_id, and account_id have been reencoded to save a little space. I can upload tables to allow conversion if needed.
matches: contains top level information about each match. see https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI/GetMatchDetails#Tower_Status%22tower_status_dire%22:%202047) for interpreting tower and barracks status. Cluster can link matches to geographic region.
players: Individual players are identified by account_id but there is an option to play anonymously and roughly one third of the account_id are not available. Anonymous users have the value of 0 for account_id. Contains totals for kills, deaths, denies, etc. Player action counts are available, and are indicated by variable names beginning with unit_order_. Counts for reasons for acquiring or losing gold, and gaining experience, have prefixes gold_, and xp_.
player_time: Contains last hits, experience, and gold sampled at one minute interval for all players in all matches. The column names indicate the player_slot. For instance xp_t_1 indicates that this column has experience sums for the player in slot one.
teamfights: Start and stop time of teamfights, as well as last death time. Teamfights appear to be all battles with three or more deaths. As such this does not include all battles for the entire match.
teamfights_players : Additional information provided for each player in each teamfight. player_slot can be used to link this back to players.csv
objectives: Gives information on all the objectives completed, by which player and at what time.
chat: All chat for the 50k matches. There is plenty of profanity, and good natured trolling.
test_labels: match_id and radiant_win(as integer 1 or 0)
test_player: full player and match table with hero_id, player_slot, match_id, and account_id
Nov 5th Update
Added several additional tables. None of the previously uploaded data was altered. I plan to add several Kernels in the next week going over how to use the data, and performing some EDA. Many improvements to the player rating method I used are possible for those interested in MMR.
player_ratings contains match counts, win counts, and TrueSkill rating, calculated on 900k matches which occurred prior to other uploaded data. trueskill ratings have two components, mu, which can be interpreted as the skill, with higher value being better, and sigma which is the uncertainty of the rating.
match_outcomes data for ~900k matches used to calculate player ratings. Use this to improve on the ratings I uploaded.
purchase_log item purchase times
ability_upgrade ability upgrade times and levels
cluster_region allows the mapping cluster found in match.csv to geographic region.
patch_dates release dates for various patches, use start_time from match.csv to determine which patch a match was played in.
ability_ids use with ability_upgrades.csv to get the names of upgraded abilities
item_ids use with purchase_log.csv to get the names of purchased items
Kernel showing how player skill was computed: Contains several resources on trueskill rating system.
Past Research
There seem to be some efforts to establish indicators for skillfull play based on specific parts of gameplay. Opendota has many statistics, and some analysis for specific benchmarks at different times in the game. Dotabuff has a lot of information I have not explored it deeply. This is an area to gather more information.
Some possible directions of investigation
Insight from domain experts would also be useful to help clarify what problems are interesting to work on. Some initial task ideas
Predict match outcomes based on aggregates for individual players using only account_id as prior information
Add hero id to this and see if there is a differences in performance
Estimate player skill based on a sample of in game play(this might need an external mmr source or different definition skill)
Create improved indicators of skillful play based game actions to help players target areas for improvement
All of these areas have been worked on, but I am not aware of the most up to date research on dota2 gameplay.
I plan on setting up several different predictive tasks in the upcoming weeks. A test set of an additional 50 to 100 thousand matches with just hero_id, and account_id included along with outcome of the match.
The current dataset seems pretty small for modeling individual players. I would prefer to have a wide range of features instead of a larger dataset for the moment.
Dataset idea for anyone interested in creating their own Dota 2 dataset. It would be useful to have a few full matches available to work on. They would need to be extracted from the .dem replay file to something easily parsed by R and Python as available in kernels. Given the size of a full match data only a few matches would be needed. There are files available from opendota' s website(check for replays). Looking at fine grained match details would potentially allow for the creation of better high level parsed data. I think it would be a lot of work just to get a handle on working with full match data so a sample would be good to have.
Orginal kaggle dataset on dota2 matches by Joe Ramir I also borrowed the image and some of the content for these acknowledgements from the above, thanks!.

Questions
Yearly how many planes crashed? how many people were on board? how many survived? how many died?
Highest number of crashes by operator and Type of aircrafts.
‘Summary’ field has the details about the crashes. Find the reasons of the crash and categorize them in different clusters i.e Fire, shot down, weather (for the ‘Blanks’ in the data category can be UNKNOWN) you are open to make clusters of your choice but they should not exceed 7.
Find the number of crashed aircrafts and number of deaths against each category from above step.
Find any interesting trends/behaviors that you encounter when you analyze the dataset.
My solution
The following bar charts display the answers requested by point 1. of the assignment, in particular:
the planes crashed per year
people aboard per year during crashes
people dead per year during crashes
people survived per year during crashes
The following answers regard point 2 of the assignment
Highest number of crashes by operator: Aeroflot with 179 crashes
By Type of aircraft: Douglas DC-3 with 334 crashes
I have identified 7 clusters using k-means clustering technique on a matrix obtained by a text corpus created by using Text Analysis (plain text, remove punctuation, to lower, etc.) The following table summarize for each cluster the number of crashes and death.
Cluster 1: 258 crashes, 6368 deaths
Cluster 2: 500 crashes, 9408 deaths
Cluster 3: 211 crashes, 3513 deaths
Cluster 4: 1014 crashes, 14790 deaths
Cluster 5: 2749 crashes, 58826 deaths
Cluster 6: 195 crashes, 4439 deaths
Cluster 7: 341 crashes, 8135 deaths
The following picture shows clusters using the first 2 principal components:
For each clusters I will summarize the most used words and I will try to identify the causes of the crash
Cluster 1 (258) aircraft, crashed, plane, shortly, taking. No many information about this cluster can be deducted using Text Analysis
Cluster 2 (500) aircraft, airport, altitude, crashed, crew, due, engine, failed, failure, fire, flight, landing, lost, pilot, plane, runway, takeoff, taking. Engine failure on the runway after landing or takeoff
Cluster 3 (211): aircraft, crashed, fog Crash caused by fog
Cluster 4 (1014): aircraft, airport, attempting, cargo, crashed, fire, land, landing, miles, pilot, plane, route, runway, struck, takeoff Struck a cargo during landing or takeoff
Cluster 5 (2749): accident, aircraft, airport, altitude, approach, attempting, cargo, conditions, control, crashed, crew, due, engine, failed, failure, feet, fire, flight, flying, fog, ground, killed, land, landing, lost, low, miles, mountain, pilot. plane, poor, route, runway, short, shortly, struck, takeoff, taking, weather
Struck a cargo due to engine failure or bad weather conditions mainly fog
Cluster 6 (195): aircraft, crashed, engine, failure, fire, flight, left, pilot, plane, runway
Engine failure on the runway
Cluster 7 (341): accident, aircraft, altitude, cargo, control, crashed, crew, due, engine, failure, flight, landing, loss, lost, pilot, plane, takeoff
Engine failure during landing or takeoff

Mass Shootings in the United States of America (1966-2017) The US has witnessed 398 mass shootings in last 50 years that resulted in 1,996 deaths and 2,488 injured. The latest and the worst mass shooting of October 2, 2017 killed 58 and injured 515 so far. The number of people injured in this attack is more than the number of people injured in all mass shootings of 2015 and 2016 combined. The average number of mass shootings per year is 7 for the last 50 years that would claim 39 lives and 48 injured per year.
Content
Geography: United States of America
Time period: 1966-2017
Unit of analysis: Mass Shooting Attack
Dataset: The dataset contains detailed information of 398 mass shootings in the United States of America that killed 1996 and injured 2488 people.

I’ve consulted several public datasets and web pages to compile this data. Some of the major data sources include Wikipedia, Mother Jones, Stanford, USA Today and other web sources.
Inspiration
With a broken heart, I like to call the attention of my fellow Kagglers to use Machine Learning and Data Sciences to help me explore these ideas:
• How many people got killed and injured per year?
• Visualize mass shootings on the U.S map
• Is there any correlation between shooter and his/her race, gender
• Any correlation with calendar dates? Do we have more deadly days, weeks or months on average
• What cities and states are more prone to such attacks
• Can you find and combine any other external datasets to enrich the analysis, for example, gun ownership by state
• Any other pattern you see that can help in prediction, crowd safety or in-depth analysis of the event
• How many shooters have some kind of mental health problem? Can we compare that shooter with general population with same condition
Mass Shootings Dataset Ver 3
This is the new Version of Mass Shootings Dataset. I've added eight new variables:
Incident Area (where the incident took place),
Open/Close Location (Inside a building or open space)
Target (possible target audience or company),
Cause (Terrorism, Hate Crime, Fun (for no obvious reason etc.)
Policeman Killed (how many on duty officers got killed)
Age (age of the shooter)
Employed (Y/N)
Employed at (Employer Name)
Age, Employed and Employed at (3 variables) contain shooter details
Mass Shootings Dataset Ver 4
Quite a few missing values have been added
Mass Shootings Dataset Ver 5
Three more recent mass shootings have been added including the Texas Church shooting of November 5, 2017
I hope it will help create more visualization and extract patterns.

Improvements
You may have noticed that for a lot of players, their national details are absent (Team and kit number) even though the nationality is listed. This may be attributed to the missing data on fifa sites.
GITHUB PROJECT
There is much more than just 50 attributes by which fifa decides what happens to players over time, how they perform under pressure, how they grow etc. This data obviously would be well hidden by the organisation and thus would be tough to find
Important note for people interested in using the scraping: The site is not uniform and thus the scraping script requires considering a lot of corner cases (i.e. interchanged position of different attributes). Also the script contains proxy preferences which may be removed if not required.
Exploring the data
For starters you can become a scout:
Create attribute dependent or overall best teams
Create the fastest/slowest teams
See which areas of the world provide which attributes (like Africa : Stamina, Pace)
See which players are the best at each position
See which outfield players can play a better role at some other position
See which youngsters have attributes which can be developed
And that is just the beginning. This is the playground.. literally!
Data description
The file FullData.csv contains attributes describing the in game play style and also some of the real statistics such as Nationality etc.
The file PlayerNames.csv contains URLs for different players from their profiles on fifaindex.com. Append the URLs after the base url fifaindex.com.
The compressed file Pictures.zip contains pictures for top 1000 players in Fifa 17.
The compressed file Pictures_f.zip contains pictures for top 139 female players in Fifa 17.

I am a huge FIFA fanatic. While playing career mode I realised that I picked great young players early on every single time and since a lot of digital learning relies on how our brain works, I thought scouting great qualities in players would be something that can be worked on. Since then I started working on scraping the website and here is the data. I hope we can build something on it.
With access to players attributes you can become the best scout in the world. Go for it!"
Netflix Prize data,Dataset from Netflix's competition to improve their reccommendation algorithm,Netflix,131,"Version 1,2017-07-20","film
scientific development",Other,2 GB,Other,"40,645 views","3,967 downloads",4 kernels,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data,"Netflix held the Netflix Prize open competition for the best algorithm to predict user ratings for films. The grand prize was $1,000,000 and was won by BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team. This is the dataset that was used in that competition. This comes directly from the README:
TRAINING DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION
The file ""training_set.tar"" is a tar of a directory containing 17770 files, one per movie. The first line of each file contains the movie id followed by a colon. Each subsequent line in the file corresponds to a rating from a customer and its date in the following format:
CustomerID,Rating,Date
MovieIDs range from 1 to 17770 sequentially.
CustomerIDs range from 1 to 2649429, with gaps. There are 480189 users.
Ratings are on a five star (integral) scale from 1 to 5.
Dates have the format YYYY-MM-DD.
MOVIES FILE DESCRIPTION
Movie information in ""movie_titles.txt"" is in the following format:
MovieID,YearOfRelease,Title
MovieID do not correspond to actual Netflix movie ids or IMDB movie ids.
YearOfRelease can range from 1890 to 2005 and may correspond to the release of corresponding DVD, not necessarily its theaterical release.
Title is the Netflix movie title and may not correspond to titles used on other sites. Titles are in English.
QUALIFYING AND PREDICTION DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION
The qualifying dataset for the Netflix Prize is contained in the text file ""qualifying.txt"". It consists of lines indicating a movie id, followed by a colon, and then customer ids and rating dates, one per line for that movie id. The movie and customer ids are contained in the training set. Of course the ratings are withheld. There are no empty lines in the file.
MovieID1:
CustomerID11,Date11
CustomerID12,Date12
...
MovieID2:
CustomerID21,Date21
CustomerID22,Date22
For the Netflix Prize, your program must predict the all ratings the customers gave the movies in the qualifying dataset based on the information in the training dataset.
The format of your submitted prediction file follows
which predicts that customer 3245 would have rated movie 111 3.0 stars on the 19th of Decemeber, 2005, that customer 5666 would have rated it slightly higher at 3.4 stars on the 23rd of Decemeber, 2005, etc.
You must make predictions for all customers for all movies in the qualifying dataset.
THE PROBE DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION
To allow you to test your system before you submit a prediction set based on the qualifying dataset, we have provided a probe dataset in the file ""probe.txt"". This text file contains lines indicating a movie id, followed by a colon, and then customer ids, one per line for that movie id.
MovieID1:
CustomerID11
CustomerID12
...
MovieID2:
CustomerID21
CustomerID22
Like the qualifying dataset, the movie and customer id pairs are contained in the training set. However, unlike the qualifying dataset, the ratings (and dates) for each pair are contained in the training dataset.
If you wish, you may calculate the RMSE of your predictions against those ratings and compare your RMSE against the Cinematch RMSE on the same data. See http://www.netflixprize.com/faq#probe for that value.

Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection,Synthetic datasets generated by the PaySim mobile money simulator,TESTIMON @ NTNU,127,"Version 2,2017-04-03|Version 1,2017-03-31",technical and legal,CSV,471 MB,CC4,"45,657 views","5,222 downloads",67 kernels,10 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1,"Context
There is a lack of public available datasets on financial services and specially in the emerging mobile money transactions domain. Financial datasets are important to many researchers and in particular to us performing research in the domain of fraud detection. Part of the problem is the intrinsically private nature of financial transactions, that leads to no publicly available datasets.
We present a synthetic dataset generated using the simulator called PaySim as an approach to such a problem. PaySim uses aggregated data from the private dataset to generate a synthetic dataset that resembles the normal operation of transactions and injects malicious behaviour to later evaluate the performance of fraud detection methods.
Content
PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The original logs were provided by a multinational company, who is the provider of the mobile financial service which is currently running in more than 14 countries all around the world.
This synthetic dataset is scaled down 1/4 of the original dataset and it is created just for Kaggle.
Headers
This is a sample of 1 row with headers explanation:

amount - amount of the transaction in local currency.
nameOrig - customer who started the transaction
oldbalanceOrg - initial balance before the transaction

nameDest - customer who is the recipient of the transaction
oldbalanceDest - initial balance recipient before the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).
newbalanceDest - new balance recipient after the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).
isFraud - This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. In this specific dataset the fraudulent behavior of the agents aims to profit by taking control or customers accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system.
isFlaggedFraud - The business model aims to control massive transfers from one account to another and flags illegal attempts. An illegal attempt in this dataset is an attempt to transfer more than 200.000 in a single transaction.
Past Research
There are 5 similar files that contain the run of 5 different scenarios. These files are better explained at my PhD thesis chapter 7 (PhD Thesis Available here http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:bth-12932).
We ran PaySim several times using random seeds for 744 steps, representing each hour of one month of real time, which matches the original logs. Each run took around 45 minutes on an i7 intel processor with 16GB of RAM. The final result of a run contains approximately 24 million of financial records divided into the 5 types of categories: CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER.

This dataset is a processed version of the YouTube Faces Dataset, that basically contained short videos of celebrities that are publicly available and were downloaded from YouTube. There are multiple videos of each celebrity (up to 6 videos per celebrity). I've cropped the original videos around the faces, plus kept only consecutive frames of up to 240 frames for each original video. This is done also for reasons of disk space, but mainly to make the dataset easier to use.
Additionally, for this kaggle version of the dataset I've extracted facial keypoints for each frame of each video using this amazing 2D and 3D Face alignment library that was recently published. please check out this video demonstrating the library. It's performance is really amazing, and I feel I'm quite qualified to say that after manually curating many thousands of individual frames and their corresponding keypoints. I removed all videos with extremely bad keypoints labeling. The end result of my curation process is approximately 2800 videos. Right now only 1293 of those videos are uploaded due to dataset size limitations (10GB), but since overall this totals into 155,560 single image frames, I think this is more than enough to do a lot of interesting kernels as well as potentially very interesting research.
Context
Kaggle datasets platform and its integration with kernels is really amazing, but it's yet to have a videos dataset (at least that I'm aware of). Videos are special in the fact that they contain rich spatial patterns (in this case images of human faces) and rich temporal patterns (in this case how the faces move in time).
I was also inspired by the Face Images with Marked Landmark Points dataset uploaded by DrGuillermo and decided to create and share a dataset that would be similar but would also add something extra.

Also, I would like to thank Gil Levi for pointing out YouTube Faces to me a few years back.
Inspiration
The YouTube Faces Dataset was originally intended to be used for face recognition across videos, i.e. given two videos, are those videos of the same person or not?
I think it can be used to serve many additional goals, especially when combined with the keypoints information. For example, can we build a face movement model and predict what facial expression will come next?
This dataset can also be used to test transfer learning between other face datasets (like Face Images with Marked Landmark Points that I mentioned earlier), or even other types of faces like cat or dog faces (like here or here). Also, using the pre-trained Keras models might be useful (example kernel).

The data describe the change in flux (light intensity) of several thousand stars. Each star has a binary label of 2 or 1. 2 indicated that that the star is confirmed to have at least one exoplanet in orbit; some observations are in fact multi-planet systems.
As you can imagine, planets themselves do not emit light, but the stars that they orbit do. If said star is watched over several months or years, there may be a regular 'dimming' of the flux (the light intensity). This is evidence that there may be an orbiting body around the star; such a star could be considered to be a 'candidate' system. Further study of our candidate system, for example by a satellite that captures light at a different wavelength, could solidify the belief that the candidate can in fact be 'confirmed'.
In the above diagram, a star is orbited by a blue planet. At t = 1, the starlight intensity drops because it is partially obscured by the planet, given our position. The starlight rises back to its original value at t = 2. The graph in each box shows the measured flux (light intensity) at each time interval.

Over 99% of this dataset originates from Campaign 3. To boost the number of exoplanet-stars in the dataset, confirmed exoplanets from other campaigns were also included.
To be clear, all observations from Campaign 3 are included. And in addition to this, confirmed exoplanet-stars from other campaigns are also included.
The datasets were prepared late-summer 2016.
Campaign 3 was used because 'it was felt' that this Campaign is unlikely to contain any undiscovered (i.e. wrongly labelled) exoplanets.
NASA open-sources the original Kepler Mission data and it is hosted at the Mikulski Archive. After being beamed down to Earth, NASA applies de-noising algorithms to remove artefacts generated by the telescope. The data - in the .fits format - is stored online. And with the help of a seasoned astrophysicist, anyone with an internet connection can embark on a search to find and retrieve the datafiles from the Archive."

Blockchain technology, first implemented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 as a core component of Bitcoin, is a distributed, public ledger recording transactions. Its usage allows secure peer-to-peer communication by linking blocks containing hash pointers to a previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency (cryptocurrency) which leverages the Blockchain to store transactions in a distributed manner in order to mitigate against flaws in the financial industry.
Nearly ten years after its inception, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experienced an explosion in popular awareness. The value of Bitcoin, on the other hand, has experienced more volatility. Meanwhile, as use cases of Bitcoin and Blockchain grow, mature, and expand, hype and controversy have swirled.

We collected EEG signal data from 10 college students while they watched MOOC video clips. We extracted online education videos that are assumed not to be confusing for college students, such as videos of the introduction of basic algebra or geometry. We also prepare videos that are expected to confuse a typical college student if a student is not familiar with the video topics like Quantum Mechanics, and Stem Cell Research. We prepared 20 videos, 10 in each category. Each video was about 2 minutes long. We chopped the two-minute clip in the middle of a topic to make the videos more confusing. The students wore a single-channel wireless MindSet that measured activity over the frontal lobe. The MindSet measures the voltage between an electrode resting on the forehead and two electrodes (one ground and one reference) each in contact with an ear. After each session, the student rated his/her confusion level on a scale of 1-7, where one corresponded to the least confusing and seven corresponded to the most confusing. These labels if further normalized into labels of whether the students are confused or not. This label is offered as self-labelled confusion in addition to our predefined label of confusion.

Each video lasts roughly two-minute long, we remove the first 30 seconds and last 30 seconds, only collect the EEG data during the middle 1 minute.
Format
These data are collected from ten students, each watching ten videos.
Therefore, it can be seen as only 100 data points for these 12000+ rows. If you look at this way, then each data point consists of 120+ rows, which is sampled every 0.5 seconds (so each data point is a one minute video). Signals with higher frequency are reported as the mean value during each 0.5 second.

Data Collection
The data is collected from a software that we implemented ourselves. Check HaohanWang/Bioimaging for the source code.
Inspiration
This dataset is an extremely challenging data set to perform binary classification. 65% of prediction accuracy is quite decent according to our experience.
It is an interesting data set to carry out the variable selection (causal inference) task that may help further research. Past research has indicated that Theta signal is correlated with confusion level.
It is also an interesting data set for confounding factors correction model because we offer two labels (subject id and video id) that could profoundly confound the results.
Warning
The data for subject 3 might be corrupted.

Dataset Information:
This is an educational data set which is collected from learning management system (LMS) called Kalboard 360. Kalboard 360 is a multi-agent LMS, which has been designed to facilitate learning through the use of leading-edge technology. Such system provides users with a synchronous access to educational resources from any device with Internet connection.
The data is collected using a learner activity tracker tool, which called experience API (xAPI). The xAPI is a component of the training and learning architecture (TLA) that enables to monitor learning progress and learner’s actions like reading an article or watching a training video. The experience API helps the learning activity providers to determine the learner, activity and objects that describe a learning experience. The dataset consists of 480 student records and 16 features. The features are classified into three major categories: (1) Demographic features such as gender and nationality. (2) Academic background features such as educational stage, grade Level and section. (3) Behavioral features such as raised hand on class, opening resources, answering survey by parents, and school satisfaction.
The dataset consists of 305 males and 175 females. The students come from different origins such as 179 students are from Kuwait, 172 students are from Jordan, 28 students from Palestine, 22 students are from Iraq, 17 students from Lebanon, 12 students from Tunis, 11 students from Saudi Arabia, 9 students from Egypt, 7 students from Syria, 6 students from USA, Iran and Libya, 4 students from Morocco and one student from Venezuela.
The dataset is collected through two educational semesters: 245 student records are collected during the first semester and 235 student records are collected during the second semester.
The data set includes also the school attendance feature such as the students are classified into two categories based on their absence days: 191 students exceed 7 absence days and 289 students their absence days under 7.
This dataset includes also a new category of features; this feature is parent parturition in the educational process. Parent participation feature have two sub features: Parent Answering Survey and Parent School Satisfaction. There are 270 of the parents answered survey and 210 are not, 292 of the parents are satisfied from the school and 188 are not.
(See the related papers for more details).

Stock market data can be interesting to analyze and as a further incentive, strong predictive models can have large financial payoff. The amount of financial data on the web is seemingly endless. A large and well structured dataset on a wide array of companies can be hard to come by. Here I provide a dataset with historical stock prices (last 5 years) for all companies currently found on the S&P 500 index.
The script I used to acquire all of these .csv files can be found in this GitHub repository In the future if you wish for a more up to date dataset, this can be used to acquire new versions of the .csv files.
Feb 2018 note: I have just updated the dataset to include data up to Feb 2018. I have also accounted for changes in the stocks on the S&P 500 index (RIP whole foods etc. etc.).
Content
The data is presented in a couple of formats to suit different individual's needs or computational limitations. I have included files containing 5 years of stock data (in the all_stocks_5yr.csv and corresponding folder).
The folder individual_stocks_5yr contains files of data for individual stocks, labelled by their stock ticker name. The all_stocks_5yr.csv contains the same data, presented in a merged .csv file. Depending on the intended use (graphing, modelling etc.) the user may prefer one of these given formats.
All the files have the following columns: Date - in format: yy-mm-dd
Open - price of the stock at market open (this is NYSE data so all in USD)
High - Highest price reached in the day
Low Close - Lowest price reached in the day
Volume - Number of shares traded
Name - the stock's ticker name
Acknowledgements
Due to volatility in google finance, for the newest version I have switched over to acquiring the data from The Investor's Exchange api, the simple script I use to do this is found here. Special thanks to Kaggle, Github, pandas_datareader and The Market.
Inspiration
This dataset lends itself to a some very interesting visualizations. One can look at simple things like how prices change over time, graph an compare multiple stocks at once, or generate and graph new metrics from the data provided. From these data informative stock stats such as volatility and moving averages can be easily calculated. The million dollar question is: can you develop a model that can beat the market and allow you to make statistically informed trades!"

This file contains a List of Risk Factors for Cervical Cancer leading to a Biopsy Examination!
About 11,000 new cases of invasive cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the U.S. However, the number of new cervical cancer cases has been declining steadily over the past decades. Although it is the most preventable type of cancer, each year cervical cancer kills about 4,000 women in the U.S. and about 300,000 women worldwide. In the United States, cervical cancer mortality rates plunged by 74% from 1955 - 1992 thanks to increased screening and early detection with the Pap test. AGE Fifty percent of cervical cancer diagnoses occur in women ages 35 - 54, and about 20% occur in women over 65 years of age. The median age of diagnosis is 48 years. About 15% of women develop cervical cancer between the ages of 20 - 30. Cervical cancer is extremely rare in women younger than age 20. However, many young women become infected with multiple types of human papilloma virus, which then can increase their risk of getting cervical cancer in the future. Young women with early abnormal changes who do not have regular examinations are at high risk for localized cancer by the time they are age 40, and for invasive cancer by age 50. SOCIOECONOMIC AND ETHNIC FACTORS Although the rate of cervical cancer has declined among both Caucasian and African-American women over the past decades, it remains much more prevalent in African-Americans -- whose death rates are twice as high as Caucasian women. Hispanic American women have more than twice the risk of invasive cervical cancer as Caucasian women, also due to a lower rate of screening. These differences, however, are almost certainly due to social and economic differences. Numerous studies report that high poverty levels are linked with low screening rates. In addition, lack of health insurance, limited transportation, and language difficulties hinder a poor woman’s access to screening services. HIGH SEXUAL ACTIVITY Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the main risk factor for cervical cancer. In adults, the most important risk factor for HPV is sexual activity with an infected person. Women most at risk for cervical cancer are those with a history of multiple sexual partners, sexual intercourse at age 17 years or younger, or both. A woman who has never been sexually active has a very low risk for developing cervical cancer. Sexual activity with multiple partners increases the likelihood of many other sexually transmitted infections (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis).Studies have found an association between chlamydia and cervical cancer risk, including the possibility that chlamydia may prolong HPV infection. FAMILY HISTORY Women have a higher risk of cervical cancer if they have a first-degree relative (mother, sister) who has had cervical cancer. USE OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES Studies have reported a strong association between cervical cancer and long-term use of oral contraception (OC). Women who take birth control pills for more than 5 - 10 years appear to have a much higher risk HPV infection (up to four times higher) than those who do not use OCs. (Women taking OCs for fewer than 5 years do not have a significantly higher risk.) The reasons for this risk from OC use are not entirely clear. Women who use OCs may be less likely to use a diaphragm, condoms, or other methods that offer some protection against sexual transmitted diseases, including HPV. Some research also suggests that the hormones in OCs might help the virus enter the genetic material of cervical cells. HAVING MANY CHILDREN Studies indicate that having many children increases the risk for developing cervical cancer, particularly in women infected with HPV. SMOKING Smoking is associated with a higher risk for precancerous changes (dysplasia) in the cervix and for progression to invasive cervical cancer, especially for women infected with HPV. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION Women with weak immune systems, (such as those with HIV / AIDS), are more susceptible to acquiring HPV. Immunocompromised patients are also at higher risk for having cervical precancer develop rapidly into invasive cancer. DIETHYLSTILBESTROL (DES) From 1938 - 1971, diethylstilbestrol (DES), an estrogen-related drug, was widely prescribed to pregnant women to help prevent miscarriages. The daughters of these women face a higher risk for cervical cancer. DES is no longer prsecribed."

Ray Kroc wanted to build a restaurant system that would be famous for providing food of consistently high quality and uniform methods of preparation. He wanted to serve burgers, buns, fries and beverages that tasted just the same in Alaska as they did in Alabama. To achieve this, he chose a unique path: persuading both franchisees and suppliers to buy into his vision, working not for McDonald’s but for themselves, together with McDonald’s. Many of McDonald’s most famous menu items – like the Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, and Egg McMuffin – were created by franchisees.

Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones,Recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living,UCI Machine Learning,101,"Version 1,2016-10-07",scientific development,CSV,64 MB,CC0,"46,442 views","4,398 downloads",109 kernels,6 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones,"The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.
Description of experiment
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
Attribute information
For each record in the dataset the following is provided:
Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Lower back pain can be caused by a variety of problems with any parts of the complex, interconnected network of spinal muscles, nerves, bones, discs or tendons in the lumbar spine. Typical sources of low back pain include:
The large nerve roots in the low back that go to the legs may be irritated
The smaller nerves that supply the low back may be irritated
The large paired lower back muscles (erector spinae) may be strained
The bones, ligaments or joints may be damaged
An intervertebral disc may be degenerating
An irritation or problem with any of these structures can cause lower back pain and/or pain that radiates or is referred to other parts of the body. Many lower back problems also cause back muscle spasms, which don't sound like much but can cause severe pain and disability.
While lower back pain is extremely common, the symptoms and severity of lower back pain vary greatly. A simple lower back muscle strain might be excruciating enough to necessitate an emergency room visit, while a degenerating disc might cause only mild, intermittent discomfort.

Can we make a word cloud of the whole book and find out the frequency of each word
Can we describe or annotate subjects in each chapter and verse
Can we find how many times The Quran has mentioned Humans, Women, Humility, Heaven or Hell
Can we compare the text with other famous books and see the correlation
Can we compare the text with laws in multiple countries to see the resemblance

Sheet_1.csv contains 80 user responses, in the response_text column, to a therapy chatbot. Bot said: 'Describe a time when you have acted as a resource for someone else'.  User responded. If a response is 'not flagged', the user can continue talking to the bot. If it is 'flagged', the user is referred to help.
Sheet_2.csv contains 125 resumes, in the resume_text column. Resumes were queried from Indeed.com with keyword 'data scientist', location 'Vermont'. If a resume is 'not flagged', the applicant can submit a modified resume version at a later date. If it is 'flagged', the applicant is invited to interview.
What Do I Do With This?
Classify new resumes/responses as flagged or not flagged.
There are two sets of data here - resumes and responses. Split the data into a train set and a test set to test the accuracy of your classifier. Bonus points for using the same classifier for both problems.
Good luck.

Sudoku-solving has gained much attention from various fields. As a deep learning researcher, I was inclined to investigate the possibilities of neural networks solving Sudoku. This dataset was prepared for that.
There are dozens of source codes to generate Sudoku games available. I picked one of them, and ran the code. It took approximately 6 hours to generate 1 million games ( + solutions).
A Sudoku puzzle is represented as a 9x9 Python numpy array. The blanks were replaced with 0's. You can easily load and explore the data by running this.
import numpy as np
quizzes = np.load('sudoku_quizzes.npy') # shape = (1000000, 9, 9)

At Quora, an important product principle is that there should be a single question page for each logically distinct question. For example, the queries “What is the most populous state in the USA?” and “Which state in the United States has the most people?” should not exist separately on Quora because the intent behind both is identical. Having a canonical page for each logically distinct query makes knowledge-sharing more efficient in many ways: for example, knowledge seekers can access all the answers to a question in a single location, and writers can reach a larger readership than if that audience was divided amongst several pages.
The dataset is based on actual data from Quora and will give anyone the opportunity to train and test models of semantic equivalence.

It is important not only for research point of view, but commercially as well for the organizations that want to understand India's complex yet strongly knitted heterogeneity. However, nowhere on the web, there exists a single database that combines the district- wise information of all the variables (most include no more than 4-5 out of over 50 variables!). Extracting and using data from Census of India 2001 is quite a laborious task since all data is made available in scattered PDFs district wise. This database has been extracted from Census of 2001 and includes data of 590 districts, having around 80 variables each.
In case of confusion regarding the context of the variable, refer to the following PDF and you will be able to make sense out of it: http://censusindia.gov.in/Dist_File/datasheet-2923.pdf
All the extraction work can be found @ https://github.com/preetskhalsa97/census2001auto The final CSV can be found at finalCSV/all.csv
The subtle hack that was used to automate extraction to a great extent was the the URLs of all the PDFs were same except the four digits (that were respective state and district codes).
This is a massive dataset which can be used to explain the interplay between education, caste, development, gender and much more. It really can explain a lot about India and propel data driven research. Happy Number Crunching!"

The lack of publicly available National Football League (NFL) data sources has been a major obstacle in the creation of modern, reproducible research in football analytics. While clean play-by-play data is available via open-source software packages in other sports (e.g. nhlscrapr for hockey; PitchF/x data in baseball; the Basketball Reference for basketball), the equivalent datasets are not freely available for researchers interested in the statistical analysis of the NFL. To solve this issue, a group of Carnegie Mellon University statistical researchers including Maksim Horowitz, Ron Yurko, and Sam Ventura, built and released nflscrapR an R package which uses an API maintained by the NFL to scrape, clean, parse, and output clean datasets at the individual play, player, game, and season levels. Using the data outputted by the package, the trio went on to develop reproducible methods for building expected point and win probability models for the NFL. The outputs of these models are included in this dataset and can be accessed using the nflscrapR package.
Content
The dataset made available on Kaggle contains all the regular season plays from the 2009-2016 NFL seasons. The dataset has 356,768 rows and 100 columns. Each play is broken down into great detail containing information on: game situation, players involved, results, and advanced metrics such as expected point and win probability values. Detailed information about the dataset can be found at the following web page, along with more NFL data: https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data.

National Park species lists provide information on the presence and status of species in our national parks. These species lists are works in progress and the absence of a species from a list does not necessarily mean the species is absent from a park. The time and effort spent on species inventories varies from park to park, which may result in data gaps. Species taxonomy changes over time and reflects regional variations or preferences; therefore, records may be listed under a different species name.
Each park species record includes a species ID, park name, taxonomic information, scientific name, one or more common names, record status, occurrence (verification of species presence in park), nativeness (species native or foreign to park), abundance (presence and visibility of species in park), seasonality (season and nature of presence in park), and conservation status (species classification according to US Fish & Wildlife Service). Taxonomic classes have been translated from Latin to English for species categorization; order, family, and scientific name (genus, species, subspecies) are in Latin.

Meteorite Landings,Data on over 45k meteorites that have struck Earth,NASA,56,"Version 2,2016-11-06|Version 1,2016-11-05",scientific development,CSV,4 MB,CC0,"18,161 views","2,212 downloads",60 kernels,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/meteorite-landings,"The Meteoritical Society collects data on meteorites that have fallen to Earth from outer space. This dataset includes the location, mass, composition, and fall year for over 45,000 meteorites that have struck our planet.
Notes on missing or incorrect data points:
a few entries here contain date information that was incorrectly parsed into the NASA database. As a spot check: any date that is before 860 CE or after 2016 are incorrect; these should actually be BCE years. There may be other errors and we are looking for a way to identify them.
a few entries have latitude and longitude of 0N/0E (off the western coast of Africa, where it would be quite difficult to recover meteorites). Many of these were actually discovered in Antarctica, but exact coordinates were not given. 0N/0E locations should probably be treated as NA.
The starter kernel for this dataset has a quick way to filter out these observations using dplyr in R, provided here for convenience:
meteorites.geo <- meteorites.all %>%
filter(year>=860 & year<=2016) %>% # filter out weird years
filter(reclong<=180 & reclong>=-180 & (reclat!=0 | reclong!=0)) # filter out weird locations
The Data
Note that a few column names start with ""rec"" (e.g., recclass, reclat, reclon). These are the recommended values of these variables, according to The Meteoritical Society. In some cases, there were historical reclassification of a meteorite, or small changes in the data on where it was recovered; this dataset gives the currently recommended values.
The dataset contains the following variables:
name: the name of the meteorite (typically a location, often modified with a number, year, composition, etc)
id: a unique identifier for the meteorite
nametype: one of:
-- valid: a typical meteorite
-- relict: a meteorite that has been highly degraded by weather on Earth
recclass: the class of the meteorite; one of a large number of classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics (see the Wikipedia article on meteorite classification for a primer)
mass: the mass of the meteorite, in grams
fall: whether the meteorite was seen falling, or was discovered after its impact; one of:
-- Fell: the meteorite's fall was observed
-- Found: the meteorite's fall was not observed
year: the year the meteorite fell, or the year it was found (depending on the value of fell)
reclat: the latitude of the meteorite's landing
reclong: the longitude of the meteorite's landing
GeoLocation: a parentheses-enclose, comma-separated tuple that combines reclat and reclong
What can we do with this data?
Here are a couple of thoughts on questions to ask and ways to look at this data:
how does the geographical distribution of observed falls differ from that of found meteorites? -- this would be great overlaid on a cartogram or alongside a high-resolution population density map
are there any geographical differences or differences over time in the class of meteorites that have fallen to Earth?

Star Cluster Simulations,Direct N-body simulation of a star cluster: Position and velocities of stars,Mario Pasquato,53,"Version 1,2017-01-07",scientific development,CSV,109 MB,CC0,"12,745 views","1,327 downloads",21 kernels,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/mariopasquato/star-cluster-simulations,"Context
Stars mostly form in clusters and associations rather than in isolation. Milky Way star clusters are easily observable with small telescopes, and in some cases even with the naked eye. Depending on a variety of conditions, star clusters may dissolve quickly or be very long lived. The dynamical evolution of star clusters is a topic of very active research in astrophysics. Some popular models of star clusters are the so-called direct N-body simulations [1, 2], where every star is represented by a point particle that interacts gravitationally with every other particle. This kind of simulation is computationally expensive, as it scales as O(N^2) where N is the number of particles in the simulated cluster. In the following, the words ""particle"" and ""star"" are used interchangeably.
Content
This dataset contains the positions and velocities of simulated stars (particles) in a direct N-body simulation of a star cluster. In the cluster there are initially 64000 stars distributed in position-velocity space according to a King model [3]. Each .csv file named c_xxxx.csv corresponds to a snapshot of the simulation at time t = xxxx. For example, c_0000.csv contains the initial conditions (positions and velocities of stars at time t=0). Times are measured in standard N-body units [4]. This is a system of units where G = M = −4E = 1 (G is the gravitational constant, M the total mass of the cluster, and E its total energy).
x, y, z Columns 1, 2, and 3 of each file are the x, y, z positions of the stars. They are also expressed in standard N-body units [4]. You can switch to units of the median radius of the cluster by finding the cluster center and calculating the median distance of stars from it, and then dividing x, y, and z by this number. In general, the median radius changes in time. The initial conditions are approximately spherically symmetric (you can check) so there is no particular physical meaning attached to the choice of x, y, and z.
vx, vy, vz Columns 4, 5, and 6 contain the x, y, and z velocity, also in N-body units. A scale velocity for the stars can be obtained by taking the standard deviation of velocity along one direction (e.g. z). You may check that the ratio between the typical radius (see above) and the typical velocity is of order unity.
m Column 7 is the mass of each star. For this simulation this is identically 1.5625e-05, i.e. 1/64000. The total mass of the cluster is initially 1. More realistic simulations (coming soon) have a spectrum of different masses and live stelar evolution, that results in changes in the mass of stars. This simulation is a pure N-body problem instead.
Star id number The id numbers of each particle are listed in the last column (8) of the files under the header ""id"". The ids are unique and can be used to trace the position and velocity of a star across all files. There are initially 64000 particles. At end of the simulation there are 63970. This is because some particles escape the cluster.
Acknowledgements
This simulation was run on a Center for Galaxy Evolution Research (CGER) workstation at Yonsei University (Seoul, Korea), using the NBODY6 software (https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~sverre/web/pages/nbody.htm).
Inspiration
Some stars hover around the center of the cluster, while some other get kicked out to the cluster outskirts or even leave the cluster altogether. Can we predict where a star will be at any given time based on its initial position and velocity? Can we predict its velocity?
How correlated are the motions of stars? Can we predict the velocity of a given star based on the velocity of its neighbours?
The size of the cluster can be measured by defining a center (see below) and finding the median distance of stars from it. This is called the three-dimensional effective radius. Can we predict how it evolves over time? What are its properties as a time series? What can we say about other quantiles of the radius?
How to define the cluster center? Just as the mode of a KDE of the distribution of stars? How does it move over time and how to quantify the properties of its fluctuations? Is the cluster symmetric around this center?
Some stars leave the cluster: over time they exchange energy in close encounters with other stars and reach the escape velocity. This can be seen by comparing later snapshots with the initial one: some IDs are missing and there is overall a lower number of stars. Can we predict which stars are more likely to escape? When will a given star escape?

From the perspective of game system designers, players' behavior is one of the most important factors they must consider when designing game systems. To gain a fundamental understanding of the game play behavior of online gamers, exploring users' game play time provides a good starting point. This is because the concept of game play time is applicable to all genres of games and it enables us to model the system workload as well as the impact of system and network QoS on users' behavior. It can even help us predict players' loyalty to specific games.
Open Questions
Understand user gameplay behavior (game sessions, movement, leveling)
Understand user interactions (guilds)
Predict players unsubscribing from the game based on activity
What are the most popular zones in WoW, what level players tend to inhabit each?
Wrath of the Lich King
An expansion to World of Warcraft, ""Wrath of the Lich King"" (Wotlk) was released on November 13, 2008. It introduced new zones for players to go to, a new character class (the death knight), and a new level cap of 80 (up from 70 previously). This event intersects nicely with the dataset and is probably interesting to investigate.
This dataset doesn't include a shapefile (if you know of one that exists, let me know!) to show where the zones the dataset talks about are. Here is a list of zones an information from this version of the game, including their recommended levels: http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Zones_by_level_(original) .
Update (Version 3): dmi3kno has generously put together some supplementary zone information files which have now been included in this dataset. Some notes about the files:
Note that some zone names contain Chinese characters. Unicode names are preserved as a key to the original dataset. What this addition will allow is to understand properties of the zones a bit better - their relative location to each other, competititive properties, type of gameplay and, hopefully, their contribution to character leveling. Location coordinates contain some redundant (and possibly duplicate) records as they are collected from different sources. Working with uncleaned location coordinate data will allow users to demonstrate their data wrangling skills (both working with strings and spatial data)."

Context
Natural language remains the densest encoding of human experience we have, and innovation in NLP has accelerated to power understanding of that data, but the datasets driving this innovation don't match the real language in use today. The Customer Support on Twitter dataset offers a large corpus of modern English (mostly) conversations between consumers and customer support agents on Twitter, and has three important advantages over other conversational text datasets:
Focused - Consumers contact customer support to have a specific problem solved, and the manifold of problems to be discussed is relatively small, especially compared to unconstrained conversational datasets like the reddit Corpus.
Natural - Consumers in this dataset come from a much broader segment than those in the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus and have much more natural and recent use of typed text than the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus.
Succinct - Twitter's brevity causes more natural responses from support agents (rather than scripted), and to-the-point descriptions of problems and solutions. Also, its convenient in allowing for a relatively low message limit size for recurrent nets.
Inspiration
The size and breadth of this dataset inspires many interesting questions:
Can we predict company responses? Given the bounded set of subjects handled by each company, the answer seems like yes!
Do requests get stale? How quickly do the best companies respond, compared to the worst?
Can we learn high quality dense embeddings or representations of similarity for topical clustering?
How does tone affect the customer support conversation? Does saying sorry help?
Can we help companies identify new problems, or ones most affecting their customers?
Content
The dataset is a CSV, where each row is a tweet. The different columns are described below. Every conversation included has at least one request from a consumer and at least one response from a company. Which user IDs are company user IDs can be calculated using the inbound field.
tweet_id
A unique, anonymized ID for the Tweet. Referenced by response_tweet_id and in_response_to_tweet_id.
author_id
A unique, anonymized user ID. @s in the dataset have been replaced with their associated anonymized user ID.
inbound
Whether the tweet is ""inbound"" to a company doing customer support on Twitter. This feature is useful when re-organizing data for training conversational models.
created_at
Date and time when the tweet was sent.
text
Tweet content. Sensitive information like phone numbers and email addresses are replaced with mask values like __email__.
response_tweet_id
IDs of tweets that are responses to this tweet, comma-separated.
in_response_to_tweet_id
ID of the tweet this tweet is in response to, if any.

For the past few months I have been searching for a reliable source for historical price information related to cryptocurrencies. I wasn't able to find anything that I could use to my liking, so I built my own data set.
I've written a small script that scrapes historical price information for the top 200 coins by market cap as listed on CoinMarketCap.com.
I plan to run some basic analysis on it to answer questions that I have a ""gut"" feeling about, but no quantitative evidence (yet!).
Questions such as:
What is the correlation between bitcoin and alt coin prices?
What is the average age of the top 10 coins by market cap?
What day of the week is best to buy/sell?
Which coins in the top two hundred are less than 6 months old?
Which currencies are the most volatile?
What the hell happens when we go to bed and Asia starts trading?

The publications include the New York Times, Breitbart, CNN, Business Insider, the Atlantic, Fox News, Talking Points Memo, Buzzfeed News, National Review, New York Post, the Guardian, NPR, Reuters, Vox, and the Washington Post. Sampling wasn't quite scientific; I chose publications based on my familiarity of the domain and tried to get a range of political alignments, as well as a mix of print and digital publications. By count, the publications break down accordingly:
It's not entirely even---this was something of a collect-it-all approach, and some sites are more prolific than others, and some have data that maintains integrity after scraping more easily than others.
For each publication, I used archive.org to grab the past year-and-a-half of either home-page headlines or RSS feeds and ran those links through the scraper. That is, the articles are not the product of scraping an entire site, but rather their more prominently placed articles. For example, CNN's articles from 5/6/16 were what appeared on the homepage of CNN.com proper, not everything within the CNN.com domain. Vox's articles from 5/6/16 were everything that appeared in the Vox RSS reader. on 5/6/16, and so on. RSS readers are a breeze to scrape, and so I used them when possible, but not every publication uses them or makes them easy to find.
The data primarily falls between the years of 2016 and July 2017, although there is a not-insignificant number of articles from 2015, and a possibly insignificant number from before then.
A note: there are some stray spaces between non-word characters at times as well as some other minor blemishes and imperfections here and there, the result of cleaning a very messy dataset."

The dataset includes all subjects' readings during the stimulus presentation, as well as readings from before the start and after the end of the stimulus.
We presented two slightly different stimuli to two different groups. Stimuli 1 is available here, and stimuli 2 is available here.
For both stimuli, a group of about 15 people saw the stimuli at the same time, while EEG data was being collected. The stimuli each person saw is available in the session field of subject-metadata.csv. (Subjects who saw stimulus 2 left the room during stimulus 1, and vice versa).
Find the synchronized times for both stimuli in stimulus-timing.csv.
For each participant, we also anonymously collected some other metadata: (1) whether or not they had previously seen the video displayed during the stimulus (a superbowl ad), (2) gender, (3) whether or not they saw hidden icons displayed during the color counting exercise, and (4) their chosen color during the color counting exercise. All of these can be found in subject-metadata.csv.
We also collected the timing (in indra_time) of all stimulus events for both session 1 and session 2. These times are included in stimulus-times.csv.

Description of the dataset
Every time a user engages a telecommunication interaction, a Radio Base Station (RBS) is assigned by the operator and delivers the communication through the network. Then, a new CDR is created recording the time of the interaction and the RBS which handled it. The following activities are present in the dataset:
received SMS
sent SMS
incoming calls
outgoing calls
Internet activity
In particular, Internet activity is generated each time a user starts an Internet connection or ends an Internet connection. Moreover, during the same connection a CDR is generated if the connection lasts for more than 15 min or the user transferred more than 5 MB.
The datasets is spatially aggregated in a square cells grid. The area of Milan is composed of a grid overlay of 1,000 (squares with size of about 235×235 meters. This grid is projected with the WGS84 (EPSG:4326) standard. For more details we link the original paper http://go.nature.com/2fcOX5E
The data provides CellID, CountryCode and all the aforementioned telecommunication activities aggregated every 60 minutes.
Original datasource
The Mobile phone activity dataset is a part of the Telecom Italia Big Data Challenge 2014, which is a rich and open multi-source aggregation of telecommunications, weather, news, social networks and electricity data from the city of Milan and the Province of Trentino (Italy). The original dataset has been created by Telecom Italia in association with EIT ICT Labs, SpazioDati, MIT Media Lab, Northeastern University, Polytechnic University of Milan, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, University of Trento and Trento RISE. In order to make it easy-to-use, here we provide a subset of telecommunications data that allows researchers to design algorithms able to exploit an enormous number of behavioral and social indicators. The complete version of the dataset is available at the following link: http://go.nature.com/2fz4AFr
Relevant, external, data sources
The presented datasets can be enriched by using census data provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) (http://www.istat.it/en/), a public research organization and the main provider of official statistics in Italy. The census data have been released for 1999, 2001 and 2011. The dataset (http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/104317), released in Italian, is composed of four parts: Territorial Bases (Basi Territoriali), Administrative Boundaries (Confini Amministrativi), Census Variables (Variabili Censuarie) and data about Toponymy (Dati Toponomastici).

Data scientists can gain insight on the logic and decision-making that the players face when put in hypothetical and virtual scenarios.
In this Kaggle Dataset, I provide just over 1400 competitive matchmaking matches from Valve's game Counter-strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). The data was extracted from competitive matchmaking replays submitted to csgo-stats. I intend for this data-set to be purely exploratory, however users are free to create their own predictive models they see fit.
About Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter game pitting two teams of 5 players against each other. Within a maximum of 30 rounds, the two teams find themselves on either side as a Counter Terrorist or Terrorist. Both sides are tasked with eliminating the opposition or, as the terrorist team, planting the C4 bomb at a bomb site and allowing it to explode. Rounds are played out until either of those two objectives or if the maximum time is reached (in which the counter terrorists then win by default). At the end of the 15th round, the two teams switch sides and continue until one team reaches 16 round wins first. CS:GO is widely known for its competitive aspect of technical skill, teamwork and in-game strategies. Players are constantly rewarded with the efforts they put it in training and learning through advancing in rank.

Content
This dataset within the 1400 matches provides every successful entry of duels (or battle) that took place for a player. That is, each row documents an event when a player is hurt by another player (or World e.g fall damage). There are over 900,000 entries within more than 31500 rounds.
mm_master_demos.csv contains information on rounds fired, while mm_grenades_demos.csv contains information on grenades thrown. The fields in the two datasets are similar: highlights include shooters and victims, event coordinates, and timestamps. The datasets also includes static information on the match winner, player ranks before and after the match, and other miscellaneous match-level metadata.
For further information on individual fields in the dataset, refer to the Column Metadata.
Interpreting Positional Data
This dataset also includes a selection of the game's official radar maps, as well as a table, map_data.csv, to aid in mapping data over them. The X,Y coordinates included in the dataset are all in in-game coordinates and need to be linearly scaled to be plotted on any official radar maps.

With more viewers, there most likely an increase of show variety. However, do people understand the distribution of ratings on Netflix shows?
Because of the vast amount of time it would take to gather 1,000 shows one by one, the gathering method took advantage of the Netflix’s suggestion engine. The suggestion engine recommends shows similar to the selected show. As part of this data set, I took 4 videos from 4 ratings (totaling 16 unique shows), then pulled 53 suggested shows per video. The ratings include: G, PG, TV-14, TV-MA. I chose not to pull from every rating (e.g. TV-G, TV-Y, etc.).

National Institutes of Health Chest X-Ray Dataset
Chest X-ray exams are one of the most frequent and cost-effective medical imaging examinations available. However, clinical diagnosis of a chest X-ray can be challenging and sometimes more difficult than diagnosis via chest CT imaging. The lack of large publicly available datasets with annotations means it is still very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve clinically relevant computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) in real world medical sites with chest X-rays. One major hurdle in creating large X-ray image datasets is the lack resources for labeling so many images. Prior to the release of this dataset, Openi was the largest publicly available source of chest X-ray images with 4,143 images available.
This NIH Chest X-ray Dataset is comprised of 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. To create these labels, the authors used Natural Language Processing to text-mine disease classifications from the associated radiological reports. The labels are expected to be >90% accurate and suitable for weakly-supervised learning. The original radiology reports are not publicly available but you can find more details on the labeling process in this Open Access paper: ""ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale Chest X-ray Database and Benchmarks on Weakly-Supervised Classification and Localization of Common Thorax Diseases."" (Wang et al.)

Full Dataset Content
The full dataset can be found here. There are 12 zip files in total and range from ~2 gb to 4 gb in size.

Data limitations:
The image labels are NLP extracted so there could be some erroneous labels but the NLP labeling accuracy is estimated to be >90%.
Very limited numbers of disease region bounding boxes (See BBox_list_2017.csv)
Chest x-ray radiology reports are not anticipated to be publicly shared. Parties who use this public dataset are encouraged to share their “updated” image labels and/or new bounding boxes in their own studied later, maybe through manual annotation

Modifications to original data
Original TAR archives were converted to ZIP archives to be compatible with the Kaggle platform

Suicide bombing is an operational method in which the very act of the attack is dependent upon the death of the perpetrator. Though only 3% of all terrorist attacks around the world can be classified as suicide bombing attacks these account for 48% of the casualties. Explosions and suicide bombings have become the modus operandi of terrorist organizations throughout the world. The world is full of unwanted explosives, brutal bombings, accidents, and violent conflicts, and there is a need to understand the impact of these explosions on one’s surroundings, the environment, and most importantly on human bodies. From 1980 to 2001 (excluding 9/11/01) the average number of deaths per incident for suicide bombing attacks was 13. This number is far above the average of less than one death per incident across all types of terrorist attacks over the same time period. Suicide bombers, unlike any other device or means of destruction, can think and therefore detonate the charge at an optimal location with perfect timing to cause maximum carnage and destruction. Suicide bombers are adaptive and can quickly change targets if forced by security risk or the availability of better targets. Suicide attacks are relatively inexpensive to fund and technologically primitive, as IEDs can be readily constructed.
World has seen more than 3,600 suicide bombing attacks in over 40 countries since 1982. Suicide Bombing has wreaked havoc in Pakistan in the last decade or so. From only a couple of attacks before 2000, it kept escalating after the US Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, promiscuously killing hundreds of people each year, towering as one of the most prominent security threats that every single Pakistani faces today. The conundrum of suicide bombing in Pakistan has obliterated 6,982 clean-handed civilians and injured another 17,624 in a total of 475 attacks since 1995. More than 94% of these attacks have taken place after year 2006. From 2007 to 2013 the country witnessed a suicide bombing attack on every 6th day that increased to every 4th day in 2013. Counting the dead and the injured, each attack victimizes 48 people in Pakistan.
Pakistan Body Count (www.PakistanBodyCount.org) is the oldest and most accurate running tally of suicide bombings in Pakistan. The given database (PakistanSuicideAttacks.CSV) has been populated by using majority of the data from Pakistan Body Count, and building up on it by canvassing open source newspapers, media reports, think tank analyses, and personal contacts in media and law enforcement agencies. We provide a count of the people killed and injured in suicide attacks, including the ones who died later in hospitals or homes due to injuries caused or aggravated by these attacks (second and tertiary blast injuries), making it the most authentic source for suicide attacks related data in this region.
We will keep releasing the updates every quarter at this page.

I wish I had some better questions to ask of the data, perhaps somebody else can think of some good ways to get some insight of this dataset."

Eclipses of the sun can only occur when the moon is near one of its two orbital nodes during the new moon phase. It is then possible for the Moon's penumbral, umbral, or antumbral shadows to sweep across Earth's surface thereby producing an eclipse. There are four types of solar eclipses: a partial eclipse, during which the moon's penumbral shadow traverses Earth and umbral and antumbral shadows completely miss Earth; an annular eclipse, during which the moon's antumbral shadow traverses Earth but does not completely cover the sun; a total eclipse, during which the moon's umbral shadow traverses Earth and completely covers the sun; and a hybrid eclipse, during which the moon's umbral and antumbral shadows traverse Earth and annular and total eclipses are visible in different locations. Earth will experience 11898 solar eclipses during the five millennium period -1999 to +3000 (2000 BCE to 3000 CE).
Eclipses of the moon can occur when the moon is near one of its two orbital nodes during the full moon phase. It is then possible for the moon to pass through Earth's penumbral or umbral shadows thereby producing an eclipse. There are three types of lunar eclipses: a penumbral eclipse, during which the moon traverses Earth's penumbral shadow but misses its umbral shadow; a partial eclipse, during which the moon traverses Earth's penumbral and umbral shadows; and a total eclipse, during which the moon traverses Earth's penumbral and umbral shadows and passes completely into Earth's umbra. Earth will experience 12064 lunar eclipses during the five millennium period -1999 to +3000 (2000 BCE to 3000 CE).

“Meetup is a social networking website that aims to brings people together to do, explore, teach and learn the things that help them come alive.”
Meetup allows members to find and join groups unified by a common interest. As of 2017, there are 32 million users with 280 thousand groups available across 182 countries.
A member needs to be able to identify groups and activities which interest them the most to be able to use this platform to network effectively.
The aim of our team was to use this dataset to build a recommender system which will identify and suggest groups and activities to a member based on their interest and additional interests of similar members. Furthermore, a social network analysis was done to identify the relationship between groups and people.

Inspiration
The online job market is a good indicator of overall demand for labor in the local economy. In addition, online job postings data are easier and quicker to collect, and they can be a richer source of information than more traditional job postings, such as those found in printed newspapers. The data can be used in the following ways: -Understand the demand for certain professions, job titles, or industries -Help universities with curriculum development -Identify skills that are most frequently required by employers, and how the distribution of necessary skills changes over time -Make recommendations to job seekers and employers

I tend to avoid marvel-transformers-standardized products, and prefer a mix of classic hollywood-golden-age and obscure polish artsy movies. Throw in an occasional japanese-zombie-slasher-giallo as an alibi. Good movies don't exist without bad movies. 
On average I watch 200+ movies each year, with peaks at more than 500 movies. Nine years ago I started to log my movies to avoid watching the same movie twice, and also assign scores. Over the years, it gave me a couple insights on my viewing habits but nothing more than what a tenth-grader would learn at school. 
I've recently suscribed to Netflix and it pains me to see the global inefficiency of recommendation systems for people like me, who mostly swear by ""La politique des auteurs"". It's a term coined by famous new-wave french movie critic André Bazin, meaning that the quality of a movie is essentially linked to the director and it's capacity to execute his vision with his crew. We could debate it depends on movie production pipeline, but let's not for now. Practically, what it means, is that I essentially watch movies from directors who made films I've liked.
I suspect Neflix calibrate their recommandation models taking into account the way the ""average-joe"" chooses a movie. A few months ago I had read a study based on a survey, showing that people chose a movie mostly based on genre (55%), then by leading actors (45%). Director or Release Date were far behind around 10% each. It is not surprising, since most people I know don't care who the director is. Lots of US blockbusters don't even mention it on the movie poster. I am aware that collaborative filtering is based on user proximity , which I believe decreases (or even eliminates) the need to characterize a movie. So here I'm more interested in content based filtering which is based on product proximity for several reasons :
Users tastes are not easily accessible. It is, after all, Netflix treasure chest
Movie offer on Netflix is so bad for someone who likes author's movies that it wouldn't help
Modeling a movie intrinsic qualities is a nice challenge
Enough.
""The secret of getting ahead is getting started"" (Mark Twain)
The primary source is www.themoviedb.org. If you watch obscure artsy romanian homemade movies you may find only 95% of your movies referenced...but for anyone else it should be in the 98%+ range.
movies details are from www.themoviedb.org API : movies/details
movies crew & casting are from www.themoviedb.org API : movies/credits
both can be joined by id
they contain all 350k movies up, from end of 19th century to august 2017. If you remove short movies from imdb you get similar amounts of movies.
I uploaded the program to retrieve incremental movie details on github : https://github.com/stephanerappeneau/scienceofmovies/tree/master/PycharmProjects/GetAllMovies (need a dev API key from themoviedb.org though)
I have tried various supervised (decision tree) / unsupervised (clustering, NLP) approaches described in the discussions, source code is on github : https://github.com/stephanerappeneau/scienceofmovies
As a bonus I've uploaded the bio summary from top 500 critically-acclaimed directors from wikipedia, for some interesting NLTK analysis
Here is overview of the available sources that I've tried :
• Imdb.com free csv dumps (ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/ftp.imdb.com/pub/temporaryaccess/) are badly documented, incomplete, loosely structured and impossible to join/merge. There's an API hosted by Amazon Web Service : 1€ every 100 000 requests. With around 1 million movies, it could become expensive also features are bare. So I've searched for other sources. 
• www.themoviedb.org is based on crowdsourcing and has an excellent API, limited to 40 requests every 10 seconds. It is quite generous, well documented, and enough to sweep the 450 000 movies in a few days. For my purpose, data quality is not significantly worse than imdb, and as imdb key is also included there's always the possibility to complete my dataset later (I actually did it)
• www.Boxofficemojo.com has some interesting budget/revenue figures (which are sorely lacking in both imdb & tmdb), but it actually tracks only a few thousand movies, mainly blockbusters. There are other professional sources that are used by film industry to get better predictive / marketing insights but that's beyond my reach for this experiment.   • www.wikipedia.com is an interesting source with no real cap on API calls, however it requires a bit of webscraping and for movies or directors the layout and quality varies a lot, so I suspected it'd get a lot of work to get insights so I put this source in lower priority.
• www.google.com will ban you after a few minutes of web scraping because their job is to scrap data from others, than sell it, duh.   • It's worth mentionning that there are a few dumps of Netflix anonymized user tastes on kaggle, because they've organised a few competitions to improve their recommendation models. https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data
• Online databases are largely white anglo-saxon centric, meaning bollywood (India is the 2nd bigger producer of movies) offer is mostly absent from datasets. I'm fine with that, as it's not my cup of tea plus I lack domain knowledge. The sheer amount of indian movies would probably skew my results anyway (I don't want to have too many martial-arts-musicals in my recommendations ;-)). I have, however, tremendous respect for indian movie industry so I'd love to collaborate with an indian cinephile !
Starting from there, I had multiple problem statements for both supervised / unsupervised machine learning
Can I program a tailored-recommendation system based on my own criteria ?
What are the characteristics of movies/directors I like the most ?
What is the probability that I will like my next movie ?
Can I find the data ?
One of the objectives of sharing my work here is to find cinephile data-scientists who might be interested and, hopefully, contribute or share insights :) Other interesting leads : use tagline for NLP/Clustering/Genre guessing, leverage on budget/revenue, link with other data sources using the imdb normalized title, etc.
Motivation, Disclaimer and Acknowledgements
I've graduated from an french engineering school, majoring in artificial intelligence, but that was 17 years ago right in the middle of A.I-winter. Like a lot of white male rocket scientists, I've ended up in one of the leading european investment bank, quickly abandonning IT development to specialize in trading/risk project management and internal politics. My recent appointment in the Data Office made me aware of recent breakthroughts in datascience, and I thought that developing a side project would be an excellent occasion to learn something new. Plus it'd give me a well-needed credibility which too often lack decision makers when it comes to datascience.
I've worked on some of the features with Cédric Paternotte, a fellow friend of mine who is a professor of philosophy of sciences in La Sorbonne. Working with someone with a different background seem a good idea for motivation, creativity and rigor.
Kudos to www.themoviedb.org or www.wikipedia.com sites, who really have a great attitude towards open data. This is typically NOT the case of modern-bigdata companies who mostly keep data to themselves to try to monetize it. Such a huge contrast with imdb or instagram API, which generously let you grab your last 3 comments at a miserable rate. Even if 15 years ago this seemed a mandatory path to get services for free, I predict one day governments will need to break this data monopoly.
[Disclaimer : I apologize in advance for my engrish (I'm french ^-^), any bad-code I've written (there are probably hundreds of way to do it better and faster), any pseudo-scientific assumption I've made, I'm slowly getting back in statistics and lack senior guidance, one day I regress a non-stationary time series and the day after I'll discover I shouldn't have, and any incorrect use of machine-learning models]"

Introduced in 1995, it has sold over 22 million copies worldwide. Learning how to play the game well requires an inherent understanding of probability, economics, game theory, and social interactions.
This is my personal dataset of 50 4-player games I played on playcatan.com in 2014. Using the ingame statistics page and a spreadsheet, I logged starting position choices, the distribution of dice rolls, and how each player spent the resources they acquired by the end of the game. Note, of course, because this dataset only consists of my games, any analysis done is most relevant for games involving me...
My personal analysis of this dataset consisted of a best subsets regression, and resulted a 4-variable model that likely overfitted, but managed to ascertain the winner correctly, in 40 of 50 games.
Questions to possibly consider:
How much luck is involved in winning a Catan game?
Does starting position matter? If so, what starting settlements lead to success from each position?
How much information on the eventual winner can be gained from starting position/settlements alone?
By looking at postgame stats, what leads to a win? Can these statistics be a guide for ingame strategy?
Data details/guide:
gameNum - each game I played has 4 corresponding rows, 1 per player.
player - the starting position corresponding to each row
points - how many points the player ended the game with (the game is won with 10 or more)
me - the position I played during the game
2, 3, ..., 12 - how many rolls of each value occurred during the game (game is played with 2 dice)
settlement1, settlement2 - each starting settlement is logged as 3 pairs of [number, resource]:
L = lumber
C = clay
S = sheep
W = wheat
O = ore
3G = 3:1 general port
2(X) = 2:1 port for resource X
D = desert
EX: in game 1, player 1's first settlement was on a 6-lumber, 3-clay, and 11-clay.
production - total cards gained from settlements and cities during game
tradeGain - total cards gained from peer AND bank trades during game
robberCardsGain - total cards gained from stealing with the robber, plus cards gained with non-knight development cards. A road building card is +4 resources.
totalGain - sum of previous 3 columns.
tradeLoss - total cards lost from peer AND bank trades during game
robberCardsLoss - total cards lost from robbers, knights, and other players' monopoly cards
tribute - total cards lost when player had to discard on a 7 roll (separate from previous column.)
totalLoss - sum of previous 3 columns.
totalAvailable - totalGain minus totalLoss.
I only ask that if you produce a good model, you share it with me! Please don't hesitate to ask any clarifying questions."

What is a note?,A collection of notes played on a guitar,Melvyn Drag,32,"Version 4,2016-11-23|Version 3,2016-11-20|Version 2,2016-11-19|Version 1,2016-11-17",arts,Other,14 MB,CC0,"5,866 views",382 downloads,15 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/juliancienfuegos/what-is-a-note,"We could take a music theory class to understand what a note is, but why don't we just find out for ourselves? In this data set we have the notes on a guitar on open strings, and on the 1st-8th frets on every string. The notes were recorded on a nice but low-end guitar called the Yamaha C-40. The guitar is in standard tuning (from the top string to the bottom on we have E low, A, D, G, B, E high).
What to do with this dataset
I didn't label any notes (except the open ones - an open A string is an A). If you want a challenge you can cluster the notes and see if your clustering lumps all the same notes together. If you want labels so you can do some inspection of notes that are the same you can look on google for a guitar fretboard diagram. I have done both of these experiments and learned a bit about music which I 'm hoping to verify soon when I find a good music theory book.
This data set might be interesting to use to be able to write sheet music from an audio sample of some finger-picked music. Identifying chords is a difficult computational task, but finger-style guitar, with clear, individual notes, might be easier. If this is the case, a simple script could be written to write sheet music from an audio sample.
One draw back about the data set is that some non-plucked strings were vibrating when I played a note. I tried various techniques to muffle them, but there is still some noise in the background. I don't know if this is because of my technique or something that happens to all players on all guitars. In any event, this noise didn't hurt my analysis.
About the data
They were recorded by me, Melvyn, using a program called audacity.
There is a directory with the name of the string. Inside the directory you will find .wav files named either open, 1, 2, ....8 for the fingering of the string. There is also a directory called ""scale"" I recorded some notes that make a ""do-re-mi..."" scale. You can use these for a number of things.
I use the GuitarTuner app to tune the Guitar - I'm just learning so I don't have an ear for notes yet. After some initial analysis it looks like the guitar might be a bit out of tune, so the resonant frequencies are a bit off from what they should be. Another thing that is interesting to think about it is how far a frequency must be from the proper on until it becomes distinguishable as a different note."

It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. The company made history again in May 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft attached to the International Space Station, exchanged cargo payloads, and returned safely to Earth — a technically challenging feat previously accomplished only by governments. Since then Dragon has delivered cargo to and from the space station multiple times, providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA.
Under a $1.6 billion contract with NASA, SpaceX is flying numerous cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station, for a total of at least 20 flights under the Commercial Resupply Services contract. In 2016, NASA awarded SpaceX a second version of that contract that will cover a minimum of 6 additional flights from 2019 onward. In the near future, SpaceX will carry crew as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program as well. Dragon was designed from the outset to carry astronauts and SpaceX is in the process of upgrading Dragon to make it crew-ready. SpaceX is the world’s fastest-growing provider of launch services and has over 70 future missions on its manifest, representing over $10 billion in contracts. These include commercial satellite launches as well as NASA and other US Government missions.
This dataset includes a record for each payload carried during a SpaceX mission into outer space.

Circadian Rhythm in the Brain,Fluorescence signal from the circadian regulation region of the brain,Kevin Mader,27,"Version 3,2017-03-21|Version 2,2017-03-21|Version 1,2017-03-21",scientific development,Other,1 GB,Other,"4,722 views",293 downloads,8 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/circadian-rhythm-in-the-brain,"Overview
The data are a time-series of fluorescence images measured of at OHSU Lab of Charles Allen (https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/oregon-institute-occupational-health-sciences/research/allen/).
Introduction
We use a fluorescent protein as a reporter for the circadian clock gene Period1. We are able to follow the expression of this gene in many neurons for several days to understand how the neural network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus synchronizes the circadian clock of individual neurons to produce a precise circadian rhythm. We analyze each image to determine the fluorescence intensity of each neuron over multiple circadian cycles.
FAQ
How where the images obtained: which animal and what staining?
The images were taken from a transgenic mouse in which expression of the fluorescent protein Venus is driven by the promoter for the circadian clock gene Period 1.
What is the anatomy of the images, and how are they oriented?
The bright line is the third ventricle, which resides on the midline of the brain. The two bright regions on either side of the ventricle are the two portions of the Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Below the ventricle and the SCN is a dark horizontal band that represents the optic chasm.
What is the bright vertical line in the top middle?
The bright line is the third ventricle. Pericytes that line the ventricle express the Venus at very high levels. We don't know the function of the circadian clock in these cells.
Challenge
Currently we have to analyze each experiment by hand to follow an individual through a couple hundred images. This takes several days. This problem is going to get worse because we have just purchased a new automated microscope stage that will allow us to simultaneously image from four suprachiasmatic nuclei.

Is the period 24 hours?
Do nearby cells oscillate together?
Do they form chunks or groups, over what range do they work?
Are there networks formed from time-precedence?"

Most information about what happened to ""usheep"" and his threats is nonexistent. He posted the html rip and was never heard from again. Agora shut down a few months after. It is unknown if this was related to ""usheep"" or not, but the raw html data remained.
This is a data parse of marketplace data ripped from Agora (a dark/deep web) marketplace from the years 2014 to 2015. It contains drugs, weapons, books, services, and more. Duplicate listings have been removed and prices have been averaged of any duplicates. All of the data is in a csv file and has over 100,000 unique listings.
It is organized by:
Vendor: The seller
Category: Where in the marketplace the item falls under
Item: The title of the listing
Description: The description of the listing
Price: Cost of the item (averaged across any duplicate listings between 2014 and 2015)
Origin: Where the item is listed to have shipped from
Destination: Where the item is listed to be shipped to (blank means no information was provided, but mostly likely worldwide. I did not enter worldwide for any blanks however as to not make assumptions)
Rating: The rating of the seller (a rating of [0 deals] or anything else with ""deals"" in it means there is not concrete rating as the amount of deals is too small for a rating to be displayed)
Remarks: Only remark options are blank, or ""Average price may be skewed outliar > .5 BTC found"" which is pretty self explanatory.
Though I got this data from a 3rd party, it seems as though it originally came from here: https://www.gwern.net/DNM-archives Gwern Branwen seems to have complied all of his dark net marketplace leaks and html rips and has a multitude of possible uses for the data at the link above. It is free for anyone to use as long as proper credit is given to the creator. I would be happy to parse more data if anyone would like to request a specific website and/or format.
This data could be used to track drug dealers across different platforms. Potentially find correlations between different drugs and from where/to they ship in the world to show correlations between types of drugs and where drug dealers that supply them are located. Prices can estimate drug economies in certain regions of the world. Similar listings from 2 different vendors can perhaps point to competition to corner a market, or even show that some vendors may work together to corner a market. There are quite a few opportunities to do some really great stuff to find correlations between illegal drugs, weapons, and more in order to curb the flow of dark net drug trade by identifying high risk regions or vendors. I can potentially do a new parse of other websites so you can find correlations across websites rather than just within Agora."

It's important to highlight that the Boston Marathon is the oldest marathon run in the US as it is the only marathon (other than olympic trails) that most of the participants have to qualify to participate.
For the professional runners, it's a big accomplishment to win the marathon. For most of the other participants, it's an honor to be part of it.
It contains the name, age, gender, country, city and state (where available), times at 9 different stages of the race, expected time, finish time and pace, overall place, gender place and division place.
Decided to keep every year as a separate file, making it more manageable and easier to deal with it.
Data was scrapped from the official marathon website - http://registration.baa.org/2017/cf/Public/iframe_ResultsSearch.cfm
I have found that other people have done this kind of scraping, so, some of those ideas together with things I have learned in my quest to become a data scientist created the set.
You can actually find the scraping notebooks at - https://github.com/rojour/boston_results . Notebook it's not very clean yet, but I will get to it soon...
I was a participant in the marathon 2016 and 2017 edition, as well as a data science student, so it was a natural curiosity.
I have done a preliminary study of some fun facts. You can see the kernel here as well as in the github page listed above.
Already some people have created some fun analysis of the results (mostly of the first part - 2016) that was the first upload, but I am curious of what people may come up with... now that three years are available, it may spark the creative juices of some.
I believe it's a simple, fun dataset that can be used by the new to play with, and by some veterans to get creative."

To assign an aggressiveness grade to a whole mount sample, pathologists typically focus on the regions which contain the IDC. As a result, one of the common pre-processing steps for automatic aggressiveness grading is to delineate the exact regions of IDC inside of a whole mount slide.The original dataset consisted of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer (BCa) specimens scanned at 40x. From that, 277,524 patches of size 50 x 50 were extracted (198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive). Each patch’s file name is of the format: u_xX_yY_classC.png — > example 10253_idx5_x1351_y1101_class0.png . Where u is the patient ID (10253_idx5), X is the x-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, Y is the y-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, and C indicates the class where 0 is non-IDC and 1 is IDC.

The Current Population Survey (CPS) is one of the oldest, largest, and most well-recognized surveys in the United States. It is immensely important, providing information on many of the things that define us as individuals and as a society – our work, our earnings, and our education.
Frequency: Monthly
Period: August 2016
In addition to being the primary source of monthly labor force statistics, the CPS is used to collect data for a variety of other studies that keep the nation informed of the economic and social well-being of its people. This is done by adding a set of supplemental questions to the monthly basic CPS questions. Supplemental inquiries vary month to month and cover a wide variety of topics such as child support, volunteerism, health insurance coverage, and school enrollment. Supplements are usually conducted annually or biannually, but the frequency and recurrence of a supplement depend completely on what best meets the needs of the supplement’s sponsor.

This dataset includes a log of all physical item checkouts from Seattle Public Library. The dataset begins with checkouts occurring in April 2005, and is regularly updated. Renewals are not included.
Content
The dataset contains several types of files:
Checkout records hold the raw data. I've dropped several columns from these files in order to shrink the total dataset size down from a couple of dozen gigabytes; they can be rebuilt by merging with the library collection inventory.
The data dictionary allows you to decode the 'ItemType' column from the checkout records.
The library collection inventory is a dataset in its own right and stores important metadata about each title, such as the author and subjects.
Inspiration
Can you predict which books will be checked out in the coming month? SPL posts fresh data every month, so you can check your forecast by downloading the new data from them.
With a bit of imagination, this can be a great dataset for logistics modeling. Make some assumptions about each location's storage capacity and where a book was checked out from and you've got a warehouse resource allocation problem.

The headlines are extracted from several GB of raw HTML files using Jsoup, Java and Bash. The entire process takes 3.5 minutes.
This logic also : chooses the best worded headline for each article (longest one is usually picked) ; clusters about 17k categories to 200 large groups ; removes records where the date is ambiguous (9k cases) ; finally cleans the selected headline via a string 'domestication' function (which I use for any wild text from the internet).
The final categories are as per the latest sitemap. Around 1.5k rare categories remain and these records (~20k) can be filtered out easily during analysis. The category is unknown for ~200k records.

The main purpose of BankSim is the generation of synthetic data that can be used for fraud detection research. Statistical and a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of relations between merchants and customers were used to develop and calibrate the model. Our ultimate goal is for BankSim to be usable to model relevant scenarios that combine normal payments and injected known fraud signatures. The data sets generated by BankSim contain no personal information or disclosure of legal and private customer transactions. Therefore, it can be shared by academia, and others, to develop and reason about fraud detection methods. Synthetic data has the added benefit of being easier to acquire, faster and at less cost, for experimentation even for those that have access to their own data. We argue that BankSim generates data that usefully approximates the relevant aspects of the real data.
We ran BankSim for 180 steps (approx. six months), several times and calibrated the parameters in order to obtain a distribution that get close enough to be reliable for testing. We collected several log files and selected the most accurate. We injected thieves that aim to steal an average of three cards per step and perform about two fraudulent transactions per day. We produced 594643 records in total. Where 587443 are normal payments and 7200 fraudulent transactions. Since this is a randomised simulation the values are of course not identical to original data.

This is an interesting dataset to get the holistic picture of higher education system in India. One of the main objective of dept. of higher education is to increase the gross enrolment ratio (GRT) to 15% by 2011-12 and to 21% by 12th five year plan (2012-17). One can look at things like the objective like this has been achieved or can be achieved based on the progress of past data. There are several other things that can be analysed from this dataset.

Wouldn't it be fun to analyze the data about a TV show that airs since the 70s?
Content
I aim to improve the dataset over time and update the files with more data. But I think that I have enough already so that people can work with it.
There are files for the following objects:
season
episode
title
actor
actor_title (mapping of actors and titles)
rating (episode rating from IMDb.com) I got the ratings from IMDb.com.
I used Scrapy to get the data from the websites.
Inspiration
Since SNL is such a long running TV show I thought it would be interesting to see how it developed over time. There are also some prejudices around, like ""there was a big slump from season X to Y"". Do the user ratings reflect that? I provided an example analysis, so that everyone can get started easily with the data.

Chess Game Dataset (Lichess),"20,000+ Lichess Games, including moves, victor, rating, opening details and more",Mitchell J,18,"Version 1,2017-09-04",hobbies and pasttimes,CSV,7 MB,CC0,"7,386 views",374 downloads,3 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess,"General Info
This is a set of just over 20,000 games collected from a selection of users on the site Lichess.org, and how to collect more. I will also upload more games in the future as I collect them. This set contains the:
Game ID;
Rated (T/F);
Start Time;
End Time;
Number of Turns;
Game Status;
Winner;
Time Increment;
White Player ID;
White Player Rating;
Black Player ID;
Black Player Rating;
All Moves in Standard Chess Notation;
Opening Eco (Standardised Code for any given opening, list here);
Opening Name;
Opening Ply (Number of moves in the opening phase)
For each of these separate games from Lichess. I collected this data using the Lichess API, which enables collection of any given users game history. The difficult part was collecting usernames to use, however the API also enables dumping of all users in a Lichess team. There are several teams on Lichess with over 1,500 players, so this proved an effective way to get users to collect games from.
Possible Uses
Lots of information is contained within a single chess game, let alone a full dataset of multiple games. It is primarily a game of patterns, and data science is all about detecting patterns in data, which is why chess has been one of the most invested in areas of AI in the past. This dataset collects all of the information available from 20,000 games and presents it in a format that is easy to process for analysis of, for example, what allows a player to win as black or white, how much meta (out-of-game) factors affect a game, the relationship between openings and victory for black and white and more."

"Person of the Year, 1927-Present",Who has been featured on the magazine cover as Man/Woman of the Year?,Time Magazine,18,"Version 1,2017-03-07","news, lifestyles and current affairs",CSV,11 KB,Other,"4,441 views",538 downloads,26 kernels,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/timemagazine/magazine-covers,"Context
TIME's Person of the Year hasn't always secured his or her place in the history books, but many honorees remain unforgettable: Gandhi, Khomeini, Kennedy, Elizabeth II, the Apollo 8 astronauts Anders, Borman and Lovell. Each has left an indelible mark on the world.
TIME's choices for Person of the Year are often controversial. Editors are asked to choose the person or thing that had the greatest impact on the news, for good or ill — guidelines that leave them no choice but to select a newsworthy, not necessarily praiseworthy, cover subject. Controversial choices have included Adolf Hitler (1938), Joseph Stalin (1939, 1942), and Ayatullah Khomeini (1979).
TIME's choices for Person of the Year are often politicians and statesmen. Eleven American presidents, from FDR to George W. Bush, have graced the Person of the Year cover, many of them more than once. As commander in chief of one of the world's greatest nations, it's hard not to be a newsmaker.
Content
This dataset includes a record for every Time Magazine cover which has honored an individual or group as ""Men of the Year"", ""Women of the Year"", or (as of 1999) ""Person of the Year"".
Acknowledgements
The data was scraped from Time Magazine's website.
Inspiration
Who has been featured on the magazine cover the most times? Did any American presidents not receive the honor for their election victory? How has the selection of Person of the Year changed over time? Have the magazine's choices become more or less controversial?"

They represent a means of personal communication that is an important communicative artifact in our current digital era. This dataset contains SMS messages that were collected from users who knew they were participating in a research project and that their messages would be shared publicly. This dataset contains two SMS messages in two languages: Singapore English and Mandarin Chinese.
This is a corpus of SMS (Short Message Service) messages collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. This dataset consists of 67,093 SMS messages taken from the corpus on Mar 9, 2015. The messages largely originate from Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University. These messages were collected from volunteers who were made aware that their contributions were going to be made publicly available. The data collectors opportunistically collected as much metadata about the messages and their senders as possible, so as to enable different types of analyses.
This corpus was collected by Tao Chen and Min-Yen Kan. If you use this data, please cite the following paper:
Tao Chen and Min-Yen Kan (2013). Creating a Live, Public Short Message Service Corpus: The NUS SMS Corpus. Language Resources and Evaluation, 47(2)(2013), pages 299-355. URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10579-012-9197-9
This dataset contains a lot of short, informal texts and is ideal for trying your hand at various natural language processing tasks. There’s also a lot of information about the messages which might reveal interesting insights. Here are some ideas to get you started:
This dataset contains Singapore English. How well do tools trained on other varieties of English, like stemmers or part of speech taggers, work on it?
What time of day are most SMS messages sent? Is this different for the English and Mandarin datasets?
Unlike English, Mandarin does not have spaces between words, which can be made up of several characters. Can you build or implement a system for word identification?"

Daily Fantasy Basketball - DraftKings NBA,Data for DraftKings NBA Daily Fantasy Basketball Contests,Alan Du,16,"Version 1,2017-12-30",hobbies and pasttimes,Other,124 MB,CC0,"1,181 views",132 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/alandu20/daily-fantasy-basketball-draftkings,"In Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) contests, contestants construct a virtual lineup of players that score points based on their real-world performances. Unlike in season-long Fantasy Sports contests,in DFS contestants submit a new lineup for each set of games. DFS contests are held for several professional sports leagues, including the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball League (NBA), and National Hockey League (NHL). The leading DFS sites today are DraftKings and Fanduel, which control approximately 90% of the $3B DFS market.
There are three primary types of DFS games: Head-to-Heads (H2Hs), Double-Ups, and Guaranteed Prize Pools (GPPs). In H2H games, two contestants play for a single cash prize. In Double-Up games, a pool of contestants compete to place in the top 50% of lineups, which are awarded twice the entry fee. In GPPs, a pool of contestants compete for a fixed prize structure that tends to be very top heavy; some contests payout hundreds of thousands of dollars to the top finisher.
Over the last year, I have developed a winning system for daily fantasy football and baseball contests. Building this system from scratch was a fantastic compliment to the things I learned as a student, from machine learning and optimization to optimal learning and game theory. I hope others can join me in researching daily fantasy basketball and perhaps get involved with the burgeoning world of daily fantasy sports.

A few ideas to get started:
What kind of position ""stacks"" tend to maximize correlation within a lineup?
How can you minimize correlation between lineups, such that you maximize your chances of winning a GPP?
What are the tendencies of some of the top DFS pros?
Can you improve rotogrinders and daily fantasy nerd player projections?
Can you predict which players are undervalued (i.e. high fantasy points / salary ratio)?
Can you predict the ownership percentage for each player in a given contest?"

The program was conceived in 1929 by the International Association of Chiefs of Police to meet the need for reliable uniform crime statistics for the nation. In 1930, the FBI was tasked with collecting, publishing, and archiving those statistics.
Today, four annual publications, Crime in the United States, National Incident-Based Reporting System, Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted, and Hate Crime Statistics are produced from data received from over 18,000 city, university/college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies voluntarily participating in the program. The crime data are submitted either through a state UCR Program or directly to the FBI’s UCR Program.
This dataset focuses on the crime rates and law enforcement employment data in the state of California.
Crime and law enforcement employment rates are separated into individual files, focusing on offenses by enforcement agency, college/university campus, county, and city. Categories of crimes reported include violent crime, murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, property crime, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle damage, and arson. In the case of rape, data is collected for both revised and legacy definitions. In some cases, a small number of enforcement agencies switched definition collection sometime within the same year.
This dataset originates from the FBI UCR project, and the complete dataset for all 2015 crime reports can be found here.
What are the most common types of crimes in California? Are there certain crimes that are more common in a particular place category, such as a college/university campus, compared to the rest of the state?
How does the number of law enforcement officers compare to the crime rates of a particular area? Is the ratio similar throughout the state, or do certain campuses, counties, or cities have a differing rate?
How does the legacy vs. refined definition of rape differ, and how do the rape counts compare? If you pulled the same data from FBI datasets for previous years, can you see a difference in rape rates over time?"

Of course, a huge shoutout to bls.gov and their open and transparent data. I've certainly been inspired to dive into US-related data recently and having this data open further enables my curiosities.

I was excited about building this data set out because I was pretty sure something similar didn't exist - curious to see what folks can do with it once they run with it! A curious question I had was surrounding Unemployment vs 2016 Presidential Election outcome down to the county level. A comparison can probably lead to interesting questions and discoveries such as trends in local elections that led to their most recent election outcome, etc."

The collection includes about 45,000 menus from the 1840s to the present, and the goal of the digitization project is to transcribe each page of each menu, creating an enormous database of dishes, prices, locations, and so on. As of early November, 2016, the transcribed database contains 1,332,279 dishes from 17,545 menus.
The Data
This dataset is split into four files to minimize the amount of redundant information contained in each (and thus, the size of each file). The four data files are Menu, MenuPage, MenuItem, and Dish. These four files are described briefly here, and in detail in their individual file descriptions below.
Menu
The core element of the dataset. Each Menu has a unique identifier and associated data, including data on the venue and/or event that the menu was created for; the location that the menu was used; the currency in use on the menu; and various other fields.
Each menu is associated with some number of MenuPage values.
MenuPage
Each MenuPage refers to the Menu it comes from, via the menu_id variable (corresponding to Menu:id). Each MenuPage also has a unique identifier of its own. Associated MenuPage data includes the page number of this MenuPage, an identifier for the scanned image of the page, and the dimensions of the page.
Each MenuPage is associated with some number of MenuItem values.
MenuItem
Each MenuItem refers to both the MenuPage it is found on -- via the menu_page_id variable -- and the Dish that it represents -- via the dish_id variable. Each MenuItem also has a unique identifier of its own. Other associated data includes the price of the item and the dates when the item was created or modified in the database.
Dish
A Dish is a broad category that covers some number of MenuItems. Each dish has a unique id, to which it is referred by its affiliated MenuItems. Each dish also has a name, a description, a number of menus it appears on, and both date and price ranges.
Inspiration
What are some things we can look at with this dataset?
How has the median price of restaurant dishes changed over time? Are there particular types of dishes (alcoholic beverages, seafood, breakfast food) whose price changes have been greater than or less than the average change over time?
Can we predict anything about a dish's price based on its name or description?
-- There's been some work on how the words used in advertisements for potato chips are reflective of their price; is that also true of the words used in the name of the food?
-- Are, for example, French or Italian words more likely to predict a more expensive dish?

This dataset was collected using our App EC Taximeter.
An easy to use tool developed to compare fees, giving the user an accurate fee based on GPS to calculate a cost of the taxi ride. Due to the ability to verify that you are charged fairly, our App is very popular in several cities. We encourage our users to send us URLs with the taxi/transportation fees in their cities to keep growing our database.
★ Our App gets the available fares for your location based on your GPS, perfect when traveling and not getting scammed.
★ Users can start a taximeter in their own phone and check they are charged fairly
★ Several useful information is displayed to the user during the ride: Speed, Wait time, Distance, GPS update, GPS precision, Range of error.
★ Each fare has information available for reference like: Schedule, Minimum fee, Source, Last update.
★ It’s possible to surf through several cities and countries which fares are available for use. If a fare is not in the app, now it’s easier than ever to let us know thanks to Questbee Apps.
We invite users to contribute to our project and expect this data set to be useful, please don't hesitate to contact us to info@ashkadata.com to add your city or to contribute with this project.
Content
The data is collected from June 2016 until July 20th 2017. The data is not completely clean, many users forget to turn off the taximeter when done with the route. Hence, we encourage data scientist to explore it and trim the data a little bit
Acknowledgements
We have to acknowledge the valuable help of our users, who have contributed to generate this dataset and have push our growth by mouth to mouth recommendation.
Inspiration
Our first inspiration for the App was after being scammed in our home city Quito. We started it as a tool for people to be fairly charged when riding a taxi. Currently with other transportation options available, we also help user to compare fares in their cities or the cities which they are visiting.

Their intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems to facilitate performance comparisons of different system types, configurations, and locations in the United States and its territories. Because they represent typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location.
Please note that TMY3 is NOT the state of the art solar data. It was used as a key component of investment analyses for several years, but NREL has released a more recent version based on satellite data and updated meteorological models that provides coverage for the entire United States. That dataset is much too large to publish here, but is highly recommended if you need the best information.
It's important to know that nearly all of the solar data is modeled based on estimates of cloud cover; less than 1% of the stations directly measured sunlight.
This data is not appropriate for time series analysis. A typical meteorological year is literally twelve months of real data from twelve different years. Please see the manual for further details.

Fact-Checking Facebook Politics Pages,Hyperpartisan Facebook pages and misleading information during the 2016 election,Megan Risdal,12,"Version 1,2017-06-06","news, lifestyles and current affairs",CSV,356 KB,Other,"2,369 views",217 downloads,8 kernels,,https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fact-checking-facebook-politics-pages,"During the 2016 US presidential election, the phrase “fake news” found its way to the forefront in news articles, tweets, and fiery online debates the world over after misleading and untrue stories proliferated rapidly. BuzzFeed News analyzed over 1,000 stories from hyperpartisan political Facebook pages selected from the right, left, and mainstream media to determine the nature and popularity of false or misleading information they shared.
 “Hyperpartisan Facebook Pages Are Publishing False And Misleading Information At An Alarming Rate” published October 20th, 2016. Here are more details on the methodology used for collecting and labeling the dataset (reproduced from the story):
More on Our Methodology and Data Limitations
“Each of our raters was given a rotating selection of pages from each category on different days. In some cases, we found that pages would repost the same link or video within 24 hours, which caused Facebook to assign it the same URL. When this occurred, we did not log or rate the repeat post and instead kept the original date and rating. Each rater was given the same guide for how to review posts:
“Mostly True: The post and any related link or image are based on factual information and portray it accurately. This lets them interpret the event/info in their own way, so long as they do not misrepresent events, numbers, quotes, reactions, etc., or make information up. This rating does not allow for unsupported speculation or claims.
“Mixture of True and False: Some elements of the information are factually accurate, but some elements or claims are not. This rating should be used when speculation or unfounded claims are mixed with real events, numbers, quotes, etc., or when the headline of the link being shared makes a false claim but the text of the story is largely accurate. It should also only be used when the unsupported or false information is roughly equal to the accurate information in the post or link. Finally, use this rating for news articles that are based on unconfirmed information.
“Mostly False: Most or all of the information in the post or in the link being shared is inaccurate. This should also be used when the central claim being made is false.
“No Factual Content: This rating is used for posts that are pure opinion, comics, satire, or any other posts that do not make a factual claim. This is also the category to use for posts that are of the “Like this if you think...” variety.
“In gathering the Facebook engagement data, the API did not return results for some posts. It did not return reaction count data for two posts, and two posts also did not return comment count data. There were 70 posts for which the API did not return share count data. We also used CrowdTangle's API to check that we had entered all posts from all nine pages on the assigned days. In some cases, the API returned URLs that were no longer active. We were unable to rate these posts and are unsure if they were subsequently removed by the pages or if the URLs were returned in error.”
Here are some ideas for exploring the hyperpartisan echo chambers on Facebook:
How do left, mainstream, and right categories of Facebook pages differ in the stories they share?
Which types of stories receive the most engagement from their Facebook followers? Are videos or links more effective for engagement?
Can you replicate BuzzFeed’s findings that “the least accurate pages generated some of the highest numbers of shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook”?"
Color terms dataset,Literal & figurative use of color terms and the colors of objects,Rachael Tatman,12,"Version 1,2017-07-26",arts,CSV,5 KB,CC4,"2,011 views",173 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/color-terms-dataset,"Color terms are interesting in natural language processing because it’s an area where it’s possible to link distributional semantics (models of word meanings based on which words are used together in texts) to things in the world. This dataset was created to help link semantic models to images.
Concrete color terms
This dataset contains a list of common items manually labeled with one of the 11 colors from the set: black, blue, brown, green, grey, orange, pink, purple, red, white, yellow.
Literal vs. nonliteral colors
This dataset is made up of color adjective-noun phrases, randomly drawn from the most frequent 8K nouns and 4K adjectives in the concatenated ukWaC, Wackypedia, and BNC corpora. These were tagged by consensus by two human judges as literal (white towel, black feather) or nonliteral (white wine, white musician, green future). Some phrases had both literal and nonliteral uses, such as blue book in “book that is blue” vs. “automobile price guide”. In these cases, only the most common sense (according to the judges) was taken into account for the present experiment. The dataset consists of 370 phrases.
Are some colors used more often in a literal sense?
Is there a relationship between how many objects are a given color and how often that color is used in a literal sense?
Can you use the color of concrete and an image database of those objects to create an automatic color labeller?"

For instance, according to the Division of Fire Safety Engineering at Lund University, ""Almost every day between one and two school fires occur in Sweden. In most cases arson is the cause of the fire."" The associated costs can be up to a billion SEK (around 120 million USD) per year.
It is hard to say why these fires are so common in Sweden compared to other countries, and this dataset doesn't address that question - but could it be possible, within a Swedish context, to find out which properties and indicators of Swedish towns (municipalities, to be exact) might be related to a high frequency of school fires?
I have collected data on school fire cases in Sweden between 1998 and 2014 through a web site with official statistics from the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (https://ida.msb.se/ida2#page=a0087). At least at the time when I collected the data, there was no API to allow easy access to schools fire data, so I had to collect them using a quasi-manual process, downloading XLSX report generated from the database year by year, after which I joined these with an R script into a single table of school fire cases where the suspected reason was arson. (Full details on the data acquisition process are available.)
The number of such cases is reported for each municipality (of which there are currently 290) and year (i e each row is a unique municipality/year combination). The population at the time is also reported.
As a complement to these data, I provide a list of municipal KPI:s (key performance indicators) from 1998 to 2014. There are thousands of these KPI:s, and it would be a futile task for me to try to translate the descriptions from Swedish to English, although I might take a stab at translating a small subset of them at some point. These KPIs were extracted from Kolada (a database of Swedish municipality and county council statistics) by repeatedly querying its API (https://github.com/Hypergene/kolada).
I'd be very interested to hear if anyone finds some interesting correlations between schools fire cases and municipality indicators!"

The Panama Paper Case is the most publicized case in the history of Pakistan. It was heard before the Supreme Court of Pakistan between November 1st 2016 to February 23, 2017. It alleges the corruption, money laundering and wrong doing by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif.
After subsequent formation of Joint Investigation Committee and its recommendations, court finally disqualified the prime minister on July 28th 2017. Since then, there is a hue and cry in the media by the incumbent political party and one question the ex-Prime Minister is keep asking is ""Mujhe Kiyun Nikala (Why They Kicked Me Out). It seems the poor man has no idea what happened and why.
Pakistan is a country of 207 million people according to the recent census and no one is giving him the answer of his question.

The Smell of Fear,Identification of markers for human emotions in breath,Joerg Simon Wicker,11,"Version 4,2017-11-28|Version 3,2017-11-28|Version 2,2017-11-22|Version 1,2017-11-22",film,CSV,94 MB,CC4,"1,821 views",105 downloads,,2 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/jswicker/the-smell-of-fear,"While the physiological response of humans to emotional events or stimuli is well-investigated for many modalities (like EEG, skin resistance, ...), surprisingly little is known about the exhalation of so-called Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) at quite low concentrations in response to such stimuli. VOCs are molecules of relatively small mass that quickly evaporate or sublimate and can be detected in the air that surrounds us. The project introduces a new field of application for data mining, where trace gas responses of people reacting on-line to films shown in cinemas (or movie theaters) are related to the semantic content of the films themselves. To do so, we measured the VOCs from a movie theater over a whole month in intervals of thirty seconds, and annotated the screened films by a controlled vocabulary compiled from multiple sources.
The data set consists of two parts, first the measured VOCs, and second the information about the movies. The VOCs are given in the file TOF_CO2_data_30sec.arff which is simply the time of the measurement in the first column, then all measured 400+ VOCs in the other columns. Roughly one measurement was carried out every 30 seconds. The information which movies were shown is given in the file screenings.csv. It gives start time, end time, movie title and how many visitors were in the screening. Additionally, the folder labels_aggregated give a consensus labelling of multiple annotators for the movies. The labels describe the scenes, each label represented by a row, then each column showing if the label is active (1) or not (0). This is available for 6 movies in the data set.
The goal of our initial analysis was the identification of markers, that is, finding certain VOCs that have a relation to certain labels and therefore emotions. For example, given the scene label blood, is there any increase or decrease in the concentration of a specific VOC?
While the first analysis gave already interesting results, we believe that this data set has a high potential for further analysis. We are currently working on increasing the size of the data. Additionally, multiple follow-up publications are being prepared. There are many posssible tasks, we focus mainly on the identification of markers in the VOC data, but there are many potential interesting findings in the data set. Are movies related based on the VOCs? Could we identify similar scenes based on the VOCs?"

As expected, the announcement resulted in a record number of petitions – including thousands of petitions involving crimes not included in the initiative, such as terrorism, murder, sex crimes, public corruption, and financial fraud.
In the federal system, commutation of sentence and pardon are different forms of executive clemency, which is a broad term that applies to the President’s constitutional power to exercise leniency toward persons who have committed federal crimes.
A commutation of sentence reduces a sentence, either totally or partially, that is then being served, but it does not change the conviction, signify innocence, or remove civil disabilities from the criminal conviction. A commutation may include remission (or release) of the financial obligations that are imposed as part of a sentence, such as payment of a fine or restitution; a remission applies only to the part of the financial obligation that has not already been paid. To be eligible to apply for commutation of sentence, a person must have reported to prison to begin serving his sentence and may not be challenging his conviction in the courts.
A pardon is an expression of the President’s forgiveness and is granted in recognition of the applicant’s acceptance of responsibility for the crime and established good conduct for a significant period of time after conviction or completion of sentence. It does not signify innocence. It does, however, remove civil disabilities – such as restrictions on the right to vote, hold state or local office, or sit on a jury – imposed because of the conviction. A person is not eligible to apply for a presidential pardon until a minimum of five years has elapsed since his release from any form of confinement imposed upon him as part of a sentence for his most recent criminal conviction.

The data was compiled and published by the Office of the Pardon Attorney. The Office of the Pardon Attorney receives and reviews petitions for all forms of executive clemency, including pardon, commutation (reduction) of sentence, remission of fine or restitution, and reprieve, initiates the necessary investigations of clemency requests, and prepares the report and recommendation of the Attorney General to the President."

It was released in May 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a roster of over 20 characters, known in-game as ""heroes"", each with a unique style of play, whose roles are divided into four general categories: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time.
I discovered this dataset on the Overwatch Subreddit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7o8hmg/my_friend_has_recorded_every_game_hes_played/
It represents a ridiculous amount of effort in terms of manually recording game results. This data, whilst in some places incomplete, gives an unprecedented view into the experience of a single overwatch player over the course of years of gameplay. From it you can track the ups and downs, shifts in hero preference and all sorts of other exciting in game trends.
Thanks to JustWingIt for their amazing collecting this data.

It was founded by Quincy Larson in 2014, who in a 2015 interview stated that ""freeCodeCamp is my effort to correct the extremely inefficient and circuitous way I learned to code...all those things that made learning to code a nightmare to me are things that we are trying to fix with freeCodeCamp."" The original curriculum took approximately 800 hours to complete; today, after several refreshes and additions, there is over 2000 hours of learner's content on the site.
freeCodeCamp also provides several helpful secondary resources for learners. One of them is a freeCodeCamp Gitter chatroom. Gitter is an open-source instant messaging service that lets users share thoughts and ideas with one another. This dataset is a record of activity from this /freeCodeCamp Gitter chatroom, containing posts from students, bots, moderators, and contributors between December 31, 2014 and December 9, 2017.
The data includes the usernames, screen names, timestamps, post content, and metadata of every post made to /freeCodeCamp in the aforementioned three year period. This comes out to nearly 5 million records overall.
The data comes in the form of a set of three JSON files, each named freecodecamp_casual_chatroom_[01/02/03].json. The three files make a continuous dataset containing all posts sent during the aforementioned period, but note that they overlap in a few days. The three files were extracted on 01-06-2016, 09-03-2017, and 12-12-2017, respectively. The included convert.py file was used to concatenate these files into a unified CSV file, freecodecamp_casual_chatroom.csv.
Some preliminary analyses using this dataset can be found at the Github repository for the freeCodeCamp's Open Data Initiative. For more details on specific elements of the dataset refer to the column metadata tab, or to the detailed documentation provided in the Gitter API Documentation.
The datasets are a contribution from freeCodeCamp as part of the freeCodeCamp's Open Data Initiative. More information about the rationale of this initiative can be found on this Medium article.
This dataset was extracted using Python code over the Gitter API. All the files were prepared by Evaristo Caraballo (GitHub: @evaristoc).
Records are not anonymised or modified and are presented ""as they are"".
Thanks to freeCodeCamp team, specially to Quincy Larson for supporting the initiative. Thanks to all freeCodeCamp students who kindly allowed to share their personal progress and to Gitter for making these data available.
If you have questions about this dataset, please contact quincy@freecodecamp.com or get in touch with us through https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience (Gitter registration might be required).
This dataset presents three years of developer chat about web technologies. Can you use it to trace the rise and fall over certain technologies, like Angular and React, over time?
What do programming newcomers tend to get stuck on the most? Are there any canned responses that are particularly common in the freeCodeCamp chatroom?

While several betting strategies have been proposed to beat bookmakers, from expert prediction models and arbitrage strategies to odds bias exploitation, their returns have been inconsistent and it remains to be shown that a betting strategy can outperform the online sports betting market. We designed a strategy to beat football bookmakers with their own numbers:
""Beating the bookies with their own numbers - and how the online sports betting market is rigged"", by Lisandro Kaunitz, Shenjun Zhong and Javier Kreiner.
Here, we make the full dataset publicly available to the Kaggle community. We also provide the codes, raw SQL database and the online real-time dashboard that were used for our study on github.
Our strategy proved profitable in a 10-year historical simulation using closing odds, a 6-month historical simulation using minute to minute odds, and a 5-month period during which we staked real money with the bookmakers. We would like to challenge the Kaggle community to improve our results:
Can your strategy consistently beat the sports betting market over thousands of bets across leagues around the world?
Do time series odds movements offer insightful information that a betting strategy can exploit?
Can you outperform the bookmakers’ predictions included in the odds data by creating a better model?
What's inside the Beat The Bookie dataset
10 year historical closing odds:
479,440 football games from 818 leagues around the world
Games from 2005-01-01 to 2015-07-30.

Racing Kings (chess variant),Over 1.5 million racing king chess variant positions,SalvadorDali,10,"Version 1,2016-11-29",hobbies and pasttimes,CSV,81 MB,ODbL,"5,986 views",134 downloads,6 kernels,4 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/salvadordali/racingkings,"1.8 million positions of racing king chess variant
Racing kings is a popular chess variant.
Each player has a standard set of pieces without pawns. The opening setup is as below.
In this game, check is entirely forbidden: not only is it forbidden to move ones king into check, but it is also forbidden to check the opponents king. The purpose of the game is to be the first player that moves his king to the eight row. When white moves their king to the eight row, and black moves directly after that also their king to the last row, the game is a draw (this rule is to compensate for the advantage of white that they may move first.) Apart from the above, pieces move and capture precisely as in normal chess.
To learn a little bit more about a game and to experience the evaluation of the position, you can play a couple of games here. Do not forget to select Racing kings chess variant and to analyse the game at the end with the machine. Keep in mind that the evaluation score on lichess website is from -10 to 10 and slightly different than in my dataset.
What you get:
2 csv files train.csv and validate.csv with 1.5 mln and ~0.35 mln positions. Both have an identical structure: FEN of the position and the score.
The score is real value in [-1, 1] range. The closer it is to 1/-1, the more probable is the win of a white/black player. Due to the symmetry I will explain the score only for a white player (for black is the same just with a negative sign.
1 means that white already won (the game is already finished)
0.98 white has a guaranteed(*) win in maximum 1 move
0.96 ... 2 moves
0.94 ... 3 moves
....
0.82 ... in 9 moves
0.80 ... in 10 or more moves
from 0.4 to 0.8 - white has big advantage. For a good player it is not hard to win in such situation
from 0.2 to 0.4 - white has some advantage. Might be hard to convert it to a win
from 0 to 0.2 - white has tiny advantage
0 means that the position is either a draw or very close to a draw
(*) Guaranteed means that the machine has found a forced sequence of moves that allows white player to win no matter what moves the opponent will make. If the opponent makes the best moves - the game will finish in x moves, but it can finish faster if the black player makes a mistake.
Your goal is to use predict a score of the position knowing its FEN.
Use train.csv to build your model and evaluate the performance on the validate.csv dataset (without looking/using it). I used MAE score in my analysis.
Construction of the dataset
Dataset was constructed by me. I created a bot that plays many games against itself. The bot takes 1 second to analyse the position and selects the move based on the score of position. It took almost a month to generate these positions.
What is the purpose?
Currently the plan is to use ML + reinforcement learning to build my own chess bot that will not use alpha-beta prunning for position evaluation and self-play. In a couple of days I will release my own findings as kernels."

Some of these ways include using different handshapes, motions, which direction the palm and wrist are facing, whether one hand or two is used, and facial expressions. This dataset compares which different sign languages use which of these grammatical building blocks.
This database contains information on the parameters used by 87 signed languages, taken from various academic sources and compiled by hand.
One analysis of this data is presented can be found in this paper, , but there are plenty of additional questions that could be asked. Some examples: - Does a language’s geographic location factor into what parameters it uses? - Does the year that a grammatical analysis was published have an effect on how many parameters it proposes for a language?

Missing people, especially kids, is a serious problem. However there is not much detailed information about it. Russian officials provide overall information without detalisation of victim's age. As a result many speculations appear in media on this topic:
Last year about 200,000 reports of missing people were filed with police in Russia.
45,000 kids lost every year
More than 15,000 kids lost every year
Radio interview - starting from minute 7:55 main point: ""More than 15K kids lost completely, i.e. was not ever found""
Some insights to official data can be found here interview, year 2012: ""Annually in Russia about 20 thousand minors disappear, in 90% of cases the police find children"".
Still there is no information about kids in recent years. If you have any reliable sources, please share."

Other variables include tankiness, potentialdamage, basicdps, attackbasicdps (damage per second with strongest basic attack*attack), chargedps, oneshotpotential (damage per second with strongest charge attack*attack), and various rankings in each category as well as growth rates for each ranking (this variable only makes sense when sorted by each variable's ranking).

Academic Scores for NCAA Athletic Programs,Survey of team's program eligibility and retention by year and institution,NCAA,7,"Version 1,2017-02-16",education,CSV,2 MB,Other,"3,874 views",514 downloads,4 kernels,3 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/ncaa/academic-scores,"College presidents across the nation recognized a need to track how student-athletes are doing academically prior to graduation. Starting in 2003, colleges and universities in NCAA Division I — the largest and highest profile athletics programs — implemented a comprehensive academic reform package designed to improve the academic success and graduation of all student-athletes. The centerpiece of the academic reform package was the development of a real-time academic measurement for sports teams, known as the Academic Progress Rate (APR).
The APR includes student-athlete eligibility, retention and graduation as factors in a formula that yields a single number, providing a much clearer picture of the current academic culture on each Division I sports team in the country. Since its inception, the APR has become an important measure of student-athlete academic success. For high APR scores, the NCAA recognizes member institutions for ensuring that student-athletes succeed in the classroom. If, however, low APR scores are earned consistently, member institutions can be subjected to penalties including scholarship reductions and the loss of eligibility to compete in championships.
This study was created, by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), to provide public access to team-level APR scores, eligibility rates, retention rates, and athlete counts on Division I athletic programs starting with the 2003-2004 season through the 2013-2014 season
Which sport or school has the highest academic score? Which schools' scores have increased or decreased significantly in the past decade? Are men's or women's team academic performance better? What about public and private colleges?"

To meet the globalization challenges raising higher education quality to the world standard is essential. Bangladesh Govt. has taken initiatives to develop the quality of tertiary education. Govt. plans to prepare university graduates in such way that they can successfully compete in the context of international knowledge society.
Accordingly, the Ministry of Education, with the assistance of the World Bank, has undertaken a Higher Education Quality Enhancement Project (HEQEP). The project aims at improving the quality of teaching-learning and research capabilities of the tertiary education institutions through encouraging both innovation and accountability and by enhancing the technical and institutional capacity of the higher education sector.
The University Grants Commission of Bangladesh is the implementing agency of the project. A HEQEP Unit has been established in UGC for implementation, management, monitoring and evaluation of the activities.
The Data set contains 500 rows and they are Timestamped showing the exact time of data collection process. The survey was conducted on Undergraduate and Postgraduate level students of a Bangladeshi Private University. Among the various columns of data, the GPA columns contains important linear data with strong correlation. These data can be used to predict other GPA columns. So that we can predict a student's GPA in advance and can take necessary steps to improve his or her score.

It is a network of four art museums: Tate Britain, London (until 2000 known as the Tate Gallery, founded 1897), Tate Liverpool (founded 1988), Tate St Ives, Cornwall (founded 1993) and Tate Modern, London (founded 2000), with a complementary website, Tate Online (created 1998). Tate is not a government institution, but its main sponsor is the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
""The name 'Tate' is used also as the operating name for the corporate body, which was established by the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 as 'The Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery'.
""The gallery was founded in 1897, as the National Gallery of British Art. When its role was changed to include the national collection of modern art as well as the national collection of British art, in 1932, it was renamed the Tate Gallery after sugar magnate Henry Tate of Tate & Lyle, who had laid the foundations for the collection. The Tate Gallery was housed in the current building occupied by Tate Britain, which is situated in Millbank, London. In 2000, the Tate Gallery transformed itself into the current-day Tate, or the Tate Modern, which consists of a federation of four museums: Tate Britain, which displays the collection of British art from 1500 to the present day; Tate Modern, which is also in London, houses the Tate's collection of British and international modern and contemporary art from 1900 to the present day. Tate Liverpool has the same purpose as Tate Modern but on a smaller scale, and Tate St Ives displays modern and contemporary art by artists who have connections with the area. All four museums share the Tate Collection. One of the Tate's most publicised art events is the awarding of the annual Turner Prize, which takes place at Tate Britain.""

relational data between different entities of the disruption data
clean dataset that provides consistent and reliable feedback
ideal for practices for many parts of the predictive modelling pipelin: feature engineering, cross-validation, stacking, etc
Magic Feature! see forum thread for more details :)
This dataset is re-uploaded since the original competition did not feature kernels, and it is made available here give people a chance to practice their data science/predictive modelling skill with this nice little dataset
The goal of the problem is to predict Telstra network's fault severity at a time at a particular location based on the log data available. Each row in the main dataset (train.csv, test.csv) represents a location and a time point. They are identified by the ""id"" column, which is the key ""id"" used in other data files.
Fault severity has 3 categories: 0,1,2 (0 meaning no fault, 1 meaning only a few, and 2 meaning many).
Different types of features are extracted from log files and other sources: event_type.csv, log_feature.csv, resource_type.csv, severity_type.csv.
Note: “severity_type” is a feature extracted from the log files (in severity_type.csv). Often this is a severity type of a warning message coming from the log. ""severity_type"" is categorical. It does not have an ordering. “fault_severity” is a measurement of actual reported faults from users of the network and is the target variable (in train.csv).
This dataset is made available entirely for educational use only, it is shared by Telstra and Kaggle for the original competition, and is subjected to their permission of usage.

""Lynching"" historically includes not only Southern lynching but frontier lynching and vigilantism nationwide and many labor-related incidents. Persons of any race or ethnicity and either gender may have been either perpetrators or victims of lynching. The lynchings in this dataset follow an NAACP definition for including an incident in the inventory of lynchings:
There must be evidence that someone was killed;
The killing must have occurred illegally;
Three or more persons must have taken part in the killing; and
The killers must have claimed to be serving justice or tradition.
Content:
The original data came from the NAACP Lynching Records at Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama. Stewart Tolnay and E.M. Beck examined these records for name and event duplications and other errors with funding from a National Science Foundation Grant and made their findings available to Project HAL in 1998. Project HAL is inactive now, but it’s original purpose was to build a data set for researchers to use and to add to.
The dataset contains the following information for each of the 2806 reported lynchings:
State: State where the lynching took place
Year: Year of the lynching
Mo: Month
Day: Day
Victim: Name of the victim
County: County where the lynching occurred (keep in mind that county names have changed & boundaries redrawn)
Race: Race of the victim
Sex: Sex of the victim
Mob: Information on the mob
Offense: Victim’s alleged offense
Note: Note (if any)
2nd Name: Name of the 2nd victim (if any)
3rd Name: Name of the 3rd victim (if any)

United States Code,The general and permanent laws of the United States,U.S. Government Publishing Office,6,"Version 1,2017-09-06",technical and legal,Other,591 MB,CC0,731 views,53 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/us-gpo/united-states-code,"The United States Code (""Code"") contains the general and permanent laws of the United States, arranged into 54 broad titles according to subject matter. The organization of the Code was originally established by Congress in 1926 with the enactment of the act of June 30, 1926, chapter 712. Since then, 27 of the titles, referred to as positive law titles, have been restated and enacted into law by Congress as titles of the Code. The remaining titles, referred to as non-positive law titles, are made up of sections from many acts of Congress that were either included in the original Code or subsequently added by the editors of the Code, i.e., the Office of the Law Revision Counsel, and its predecessors in the House of Representatives. Positive law titles are identified by an asterisk on the Search & Browse page. For an explanation of the meaning of positive law, see the Positive Law Codification page.
Each title of the Code is subdivided into a combination of smaller units such as subtitles, chapters, subchapters, parts, subparts, and sections, not necessarily in that order. Sections are often subdivided into a combination of smaller units such as subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, subclauses, and items. In the case of a positive law title, the units are determined by Congress in the laws that enact and later amend the title. In the case of a non-positive law title, the organization of the title since 1926 has been determined by the editors of the Code and has generally followed the organization of the underlying acts 1 as much as possible. For example, chapter 7 of title 42 sets out the titles, parts, and sections of the Social Security Act as corresponding subchapters, parts, and sections of the chapter.
In addition to the sections themselves, the Code includes statutory provisions set out as statutory notes, the Constitution, several sets of Federal court rules, and certain Presidential documents, such as Executive orders, determinations, notices, and proclamations, that implement or relate to statutory provisions in the Code. The Code does not include treaties, agency regulations, State or District of Columbia laws, or most acts that are temporary or special, such as those that appropriate money for specific years or that apply to only a limited number of people or a specific place. For an explanation of the process of determining which new acts are included in the Code, see the About Classification page.
The Code also contains editorially created source credits, notes, and tables that provide information about the source of Code sections, their arrangement, the references they contain, and their history.
The law contained in the Code is the product of over 200 years of legislating. Drafting styles have changed over the years, and the resulting differences in laws are reflected in the Code. Similarly, Code editorial styles and policies have evolved over the 80-plus years since the Code was first adopted. As a result, not all acts have been handled in a consistent manner in the Code over time. This guide explains the editorial styles and policies currently used to produce the Code, but the reader should be aware that some things may have been done differently in the past. However, despite the evolution of style over the years, the accuracy of the information presented in the Code has always been, and will always remain, a top priority.

NYC Filming Permits,Information on ~40k Filming Locations,City of New York,6,photography,"film
leisure activities",CSV,13 MB,CC0,681 views,49 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-filming-permits,"A list of film and television permits received from the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment in response to a series of FOIL requests in 2015. The permits stretch from October 2011 through September 2015.
ProjectTitle: The title of the film/television project.
EventName: A shorthand name for the specific shoot/event being permitted, e.g. SunsetPark-010815.
EventType: One of the following: Scouting Permit, Rigging Permit, Shooting Permit, Film Shoot / Production, DCAS Prep/Shoot/Wrap Permit, Grid Request, or Red Carpet Premiere. According to the MOME, Shooting Permit and Film Shoot / Production are interchangeable.
EventStartDate and EventEndDate: The start and end date and time of the permit.
Location: One or more locations covered by the permit.
Boro: What borough the listed locations are in.
ProjectId: An internal identifier.
CategoryName: Film or Television.
SubCategoryName: Includes values such as Pilot, Student Film, Variety, Reality, etc. This probably isn't a reliable classification for TV shows: it's chosen by the permit applicant on the online form and is not vetted by the Mayor's Office. It also includes overlapping subcategories. For example, a show could be both a Morning Show and a Talk Show but would have to choose one or the other.
CompanyName: The supplied production company name, which can be useful in connecting a working title to an actual film/show.
The project title is sometimes a variation on the actual title (e.g. Mozart in the Jungle S1 or The Wolf of Wall Street ReShoots) or a working title (e.g. Untitled Female Buddy Cop Movie instead of The Heat, St James Place instead of Bridge of Spies).
In some cases, the locations listed actually span multiple boroughs, and the Boro field only represents the primary borough, or the borough of the first listed location. In some cases, the Boro field is blank.
A given shooting permit can have any number of locations listed for a single day. According to the guidelines, the locations are supposed to be listed in the order they're used on that day. Most locations are either an address or a range of blocks in the format of STREET 1 between STREET 2 and STREET 3.
Permits are generally required when asserting the exclusive use of city property, like a sidewalk, a street, or a park. A shooting permit on a street doesn't necessarily mean there is exterior shooting on the street. It may just mean, for example, that something is being shot indoors and the crew needs special parking privileges for trucks. See ""When a Permit is Required"".
Shooting on Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) property, like in a city courthouse, involves an additional permitting process.
Shooting on MTA property or on state/federal property is subject to a different permitting process.
A shooting permit is typically, but not always, for a single day or a single overnight period.

I decided to spend the afternoon and build my own. We probably won't use this information this year, but it might be something we could use in the future. I created a simple web parser in Go, and parsed the data from the Emmy Awards Website. The data is a representation of Primetime Emmy Nominees from the first Emmy Awards (1949)... to the current ones that will air Sunday September 17th, 2017. After this date, the winner will have to be updated. In work we've done with Academy Awards, we used movie title and name as the main structure for the data. I kind of felt this was a little inconsistent as certain awards focus on one or the other. With the Emmy Nominees, I made it more general with nominee and additional detail, I believe this will make the data more consistent and easier to manipulate.
I based the structure of the data from the Kaggle dataset of the Academy Awards . I would also like to acknowledge the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for providing the data on their website.

Texts are balanced in terms of the variety, consisting of 48 European Portuguese texts and 52 Brazilian Portuguese texts. You can find more information in the paper that describes the corpus. The complete inventory of texts is here and more detail regarding annotation can be found here.
Part of Speech (POS) Tags
The works in this corpus have been automatically tagged for their part of speech (POS). The tagset used to annotate the corpus is presented in the table below. It contains not only the classic POS tags (e.g. V, DET, N) but also a couple of compound tags, such as the combination of preposition plus determiner as (PREP+DET) or verb plus pronoun (V+P). The tool used to annotate the corpus was TreeTagger.
Category POS Example Adjective ADJ bonita Adverb ADV muita Determiner DET os Cardinal CARD primeiro Noun NOM mesa Pronoun P eles Preposition PRP de Verb V fazer Interjection I Oh! Commas VIRG , Punctuation SENT .

On April 18, 2017, prime minister Theresa May announced that she was seeking a general election to be held on June 8. The day after, the MPs voted to dissolve Parliament and a new election is confirmed. It would be interesting to do some analysis of past election results on the 650 constituencies in to find out:
The most vulnerable seats from each party.
The seats targeted by each party.
Can the Brexit referendum result affect the outcome of this election in a particular region of the UK?
How a swing of x% from party A to party B affect the seat distribution?
among many other relevant questions.

As people who like data analysis , but young enough to still like gaming, we thought that League of legends would be a great game to analyze. Due to competitive play some statistics and predictions were quite welcome. There are of course a lot of websites that offer that by them selves, but we think that League community needed an open dataset to work with, as there was none that offered some real volume of data. There came the idea for a bigger dataset which would offer other people to drive their projects without the struggle of long lasting process of parsing matches with Riot API (which has a limit of 500 calls per 10 minutes...so yea)
This is NOT the finished project, but more like a post along the way. The dataset only consists of one column and its basically useless by it self. The file consists of 223 715 match IDs of ranked games . Each column represents the MatchId of a single match played in League, which can be than accessed with Riot API The purpose is only to allow others like us, to continue the research with Riot API with some pre gathered data and save them some precious time that way.
The final dataset ""League of Legends MatchesDataset V1.0"" we will be posting, consists of 100 000 matches in JSON which will be directly suitable for data analysis.
Link to the dataset: WIP
We are also open sourcing the data gathering program (written in python)
This project has been posted by me (Lan Vukušič) as data scientist but the main credit goes to lead programmer Matej Urbas who is responsible for the data gathering in this project and without whom the project would not exist.
We are happy to give the dataset out for free, to let the comunity use that dataset. We would love to see what people are going to create. We know that we are ""rookies"" in that field but would still like to contribute to evergrowing field of data science. So if there is really anything that should be changed in upcoming updates please feel free to message us and tell us your thoughts.

Each country and territory is given a total press freedom score from 0 (best) to 100 (worst) on the basis of 23 methodology questions divided into three subcategories. The total score determines the status designation of Free, Partly Free, or Not Free. The scores and reports included in Freedom of the Press 2016 cover events that took place between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015.
The level of press freedom in each country and territory is evaluated through 23 methodology questions divided into three broad categories: the legal environment, the political environment, and the economic environment. For each methodology question, a lower number of points is allotted for a more free situation, while a higher number of points is allotted for a less free environment. A country or territory’s final score (from 0 to 100) represents the total of the points allotted for each question. A total score of 0 to 30 results in a press freedom status of Free; 31 to 60 results in a status of Partly Free; and 61 to 100 indicates a status of Not Free.
The legal environment category encompasses an examination of both the laws and regulations that could influence media content, and the extent to which they are used in practice to enable or restrict the media’s ability to operate. We assess the positive impact of legal and constitutional guarantees for freedom of expression; the potentially negative aspects of security legislation, the penal code, and other statutes; penalties for libel and defamation; the existence of and ability to use freedom of information legislation; the independence of the judiciary and official regulatory bodies; registration requirements for both media outlets and journalists; and the ability of journalists’ organizations to operate freely.
Under the political environment category, we evaluate the degree of political influence in the content of news media. Issues examined include the editorial independence of both state-owned and privately owned outlets; access to information and sources; official censorship and self-censorship; the vibrancy of the media and the diversity of news available within each country or territory; the ability of both foreign and local reporters to cover the news in person without obstacles or harassment; and reprisals against journalists or bloggers by the state or other actors, including arbitrary detention, violent assaults, and other forms of intimidation.
Our third category examines the economic environment for the media. This includes the structure of media ownership; transparency and concentration of ownership; the costs of establishing media as well as any impediments to news production and distribution; the selective withholding of advertising or subsidies by the state or other actors; the impact of corruption and bribery on content; and the extent to which the economic situation in a country or territory affects the development and sustainability of the media."

Smogon 6v6 is one of the most popular formats for competitive Pokemon. Although it is not the ""official"" competitive format, there is still a significant number of people who play the format. There are a number of 'tiers' of Pokemon in which people can play, the most popular being OU. This dataset seeks to display both a Pokemon's stats and corresponding tier for easier competitive analysis.
In addition to the addition of the 'Tier' variable, there are several other changes I made to the set:
Classified Mythical Pokemon as 'Legendary'
Changed the naming convention of Mega Evolutions and some form changes
Addition of 'Mega' tier to signify Mega Evolutions
Note that this dataset includes only Pokemon tiered from PU to AG. NFE and LC Pokemon are not included unless they appear in Smogon's list. List of which Pokemon are in which tier was found here.

Halloween is one of the largest datasets out there. In the trick-or-treat baskets little kids carry down the streets is a bank of knowledge and data that can unleash the trends found in communities around America. When I want trick-or-treating this halloween, I was intrigued to find what kind of candy I got, which one I got the most of, and most importantly, how did the price affect consumer choices in my community.
When I got back from trick-or treating this October 31st, 2017 (data is fresh like a cucumber), I made sure to empty out what I collected in my middle-class community and sort it out by brand, type/category, price, flavor, etc. After deciding which factors were most relevant, I created three graphs - one bar graph showing the amount of candies collected for each brand, another bar graph looking at the quantity for each type/category of confectionery, and finally, a line graph that analyzed the relationship between unit price per piece and amount of candies collected. All of this is for the sole purpose of displaying how different factors such as brand and price affect consumer choices, appeal to the general population, and what kind of candies to be expecting next year! This is an analysis of middle class economics, brand appeal, and choice of consumers.
I would like to thank my sister, who helped contribute to half of my dataset by trick-or-treating in different parts of the neighborhood, making sure the sample collected would be diverse! I also appreciate my dad's interest in this project and his own expertise that was involved in filtering everything out and making the dataset as accurate as possible!
From publishing this dataset, I hope to inspire many more young data scientists such as myself to take on new projects that intrigue them or analyze their own halloween candy from their community/neighborhood! I wanted to see how simple festivals like Halloween are affected by variables like consumer choice, price range, and brand appeal. Keep in mind, this is an analysis of my middle-class community. There are many more datasets and demographics waiting to be analyzed!"

Currently, this collection includes over eighty titles that were digitized with special funding from the Chancellor and the University Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Southern United States has been a distinct region since the colonial period, and its literature has developed in connection with, but also divergently from American literature as a whole. The South claims prominent and world-renowned authors, including Edgar Allan Poe and Mark Twain, but also lesser known authors who created works that reflected Southern attitudes and experiences. Teachers of literature as well as historians and other scholars of Southern culture need access to literary texts that illustrate these differences, and many of these important Southern works are no longer in print and are not widely held in libraries. Noting this lack of available titles, the late Dr. Robert Bain volunteered to help Documenting the American South by developing the bibliography for it. Dr. Bain was a faculty member at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and taught American and Southern literature from 1964 until 1995. He also co-edited five scholarly works on Southern writers. To prepare this bibliography of Southern Literature, Dr. Bain wrote to some fifty scholars throughout the United States who specialize in Southern and American literature requesting that they nominate what they considered to be the ten most important works of Southern literature published before 1920. From their responses, Dr. Bain compiled the bibliography on which this collection is based. He completed the list three months before his death in July 1996. With additional funding from the University Library, this collection continues to grow. Dr. Joe Flora, professor of English at UNC-Chapel Hill, guides the expansion of this collection beyond Dr. Bain's original bibliography. The original texts for the ""Library of Southern Literature"" come from the University Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which includes the Southern Historical Collection, one of the largest collections of Southern manuscripts in the country and the North Carolina Collection, the most complete printed documentation of a single state anywhere. The DocSouth Editorial Board, composed of faculty and librarians at UNC and staff from the UNC Press, oversees this collection and all other collections on Documenting the American South.
Context
The North American Slave Narratives collection at the University of North Carolina contains 344 items and is the most extensive collection of such documents in the world.
The physical collection was digitized and transcribed by students and library employees. This means that the text is far more reliable than uncorrected OCR output which is common in digitized archives.
More information about the collection and access to individual page images can be be found here: http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh
The plain text files have been optimized for use in Voyant and can also be used in text mining projects such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis and natural language processing. Please note that the full text contains paratextual elements such as title pages and appendices which will be included in any word counts you perform. You may wish to delete these in order to focus your analysis on just the narratives.
The .csv file acts as a table of contents for the collection and includes Title, Author, Publication Date a url pointing to the digitized version of the text and a unique url pointing to a version of the text in plain text (this is particularly useful for use with Voyant: http://voyant-tools.org/).

About the DocSouth Data Project
Doc South Data provides access to some of the Documenting The American South collections in formats that work well with common text mining and data analysis tools.
Documenting the American South is one of the longest running digital publishing initiatives at the University of North Carolina. It was designed to give researchers digital access to some of the library’s unique collections in the form of high quality page scans as well as structured, corrected and machine readable text.
Doc South Data is an extension of this original goal and has been designed for researchers who want to use emerging technology to look for patterns across entire texts or compare patterns found in multiple texts. We have made it easy to use tools such as Voyant (http://voyant-tools.org/) to conduct simple word counts and frequency visualizations (such as word clouds) or to use other tools to perform more complex processes such as topic modeling, named-entity recognition or sentiment analysis."

This is my first pet project ever. In this project I'm going to do exploratory analysis on the top rated IMDb movies of all time. I wanted to analyse the the box office success of a highly rated movie and its relationship with various variables like, the age, gender of user/voter. For this purpose I looked at the top 100 Movies of all time on IMDb. I used Octoparse for scraping.
I realized that it would be too complicated to analyse movies over various generations, because the tastes of every generation is different, so I narrowed down onto movies of this decade, i.e. movies released between 2010-2016 ) both years included, I know 2010 doesn't really fall in to this decade, but included it in order to have a decent sized data set. Then I narrowed down to movies targeting a particular culture, because Indian movies and American movies are quite different, and trying to predict what people like, with both kinds of movies mixed up didn't seem like a good idea.
I excluded movies released in 2017 as it takes time for ratings to stabilize and box office reports to be finalized.
So from this list, I further shortened the list to movies made in English, and finally ended up with a dataset of 118 movies and 55 variables. One of the most important variable, the box office collections of each movie could not be scraped due to technical difficulties, this is an area I really need help with, so if someone can contribute here, it would be great!

CourtListener is a free legal research website containing millions of legal opinions from federal and state courts. With CourtListener, lawyers, journalists, academics, and the public can research an important case, stay up to date with new opinions as they are filed, or do deep analysis using our raw data.
This dataset contains the corpus of all Supreme Court opinions and some additional supporting information. Corpus was initially collated as individual JSON objects here; these JSON objects were joined into a single csv. Note that the actual opinions column is rendered in HTML.

education",{}JSON,30 MB,Other,395 views,25 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/unicode-100-character-database-in-json,"Context:
In working on Unicode implementations, it is often useful to access the full content of the Unicode Character Database (UCD). For example, in establishing mappings from characters to glyphs in fonts, it is convenient to see the character scalar value, the character name, the character East Asian width, along with the shape and metrics of the proposed glyph to map to; looking at all this data simultaneously helps in evaluating the mapping.
This is a machine-readable version of the Unicode Character Database in JSON format.
Content:
The majority of information about individual codepoints is represented using properties. Each property, except for the Special_Case_Condition and Name_Alias properties, is represented by an attribute. In an XML data file, the absence of an attribute (may be only on some code-points) means that the document does not express the value of the corresponding property. Conversely, the presence of an attribute is an expression of the corresponding property value; the implied null value is represented by the empty string.
The Name_Alias property is represented by zero or more name-alias child elements. Unlike the situation for properties represented by attributes, it is not possible to determine whether all of the aliases have been represented in a data file by inspecting that data file.
The name of an attribute is the abbreviated name of the property as given in the file PropertyAliases.txt in version 6.1.0 of the UCD. For the Unihan properties, the name is that given in the various versions of the Unihan database (some properties are no longer present in version 6.1.0).
For catalog and enumerated properties, the values are those listed in the file PropertyValueAliases.txt in version 6.1.0 of the UCD; if there is an abbreviated name, it is used, otherwise the long name is used. Note that the set of possible values for a property captured in this schema may change from one version to the next.
The following properties are associated with code points:
Age property
Name properties
Name Aliases
Block
General Category
Combining properties
Bidirectionality properties
Decomposition properties
Numeric Properties
Joining properties
Linebreak properties
East Asian Width property
Case properties
Script properties
ISO Comment properties
Hangul properties
Indic properties
Identifier and Pattern and programming language properties
Properties related to function and graphic characteristics
Properties related to boundaries

Hence, it could be of great commercial importance to develop a model which could predict the success of a movie before it's release. However, it is not easy to forecast demand for a movie. There are a number of factors like Actors, Directors, Time of Release, Genre, Production house etc. which affect the outcome of a movie.
The primary requirement to develop such a model would be the availability of Bollywood movie data. Thus, I created this dataset while working on my senior year research project, titled 'Predicting success of upcoming Bollywood movies'.
The data has been created manually by visiting different websites. The primary ones being Wikipedia, boxofficeindia.com and IMDB. The data contains 1285 rows with movies released between the years 2001 to 2014.

Section 8 (b) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires EPA to compile, keep current and publish a list of each chemical substance that is manufactured or processed, including imports, in the United States for uses under TSCA. Also called the “TSCA Inventory” or simply “the Inventory,” it plays a central role in the regulation of most industrial chemicals in the United States.
The initial reporting period by manufacturers, processors and importers was January to May of 1978 for chemical substances that had been in commerce since January of 1975. The Inventory was initially published in 1979, and a second version, containing about 62,000 chemical substances, was published in 1982. The TSCA Inventory has continued to grow since then, and now lists about 85,000 chemicals.
EPA’s compilation of the public TSCA Inventory information is updated twice a year to include new and corrected TSCA Inventory chemical listings, and it contains none of the chemical identities claimed as confidential. Thus it is not as complete nor current as the information contained in EPA's TSCA Master Inventory File, which includes the chemical identities claimed as confidential and is updated continuously as new and corrected information is received by EPA. Consequently, for the purposes of TSCA compliance, the TSCA Master Inventory File maintained by EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics is the only complete and accurate source that can provide authoritative and conclusive information about which chemical substances are currently included in the TSCA Inventory.
The EPA updates this registry is twice per year. The version here was downloaded on Oct 18th, 2017. Check the EPA website for updated versions: https://www.epa.gov/tsca-inventory/how-access-tsca-inventory.
There are lots of air quality and pollution datasets that you can use in conjunction with this TSCA Registry to learn more about contaminants and chemicals in general."

If a paper has multiple authors from Industry and Indian University, we count that paper as university paper.
If a paper published by industry and non-Indian university, we count that paper as Industry paper.
During cleaning of data, we consider the different name of Institute as single Institute. For example IIT-Madras, Indian Institute of Technology and IIT-M count as the same institute.
We also consider the different name of same industry as single industry, For example, TCS and tata consultancy service count as the same industry.

I found this dataset after reading a Five Thirty Eight article. The author got a tally of every death and cuss word in Tarantino's movies. That's no small feat considering the content of Tarantino flicks! Such endurance!
Content
movie: Film title
type: Whether the event was a profane word or a death
word: The specific profane word, if the event was a word
minutes_in: The number of minutes into the film the event occurred

Context
Electronic medical records contain multi-format electronic medical data that consist of an abundance of medical knowledge. Facing with patients symptoms, experienced caregivers make right medical decisions based on their professional knowledge that accurately grasps relationships between symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments. We aim to capture these relationships by constructing a large and high-quality heterogeneous graph linking patients, diseases, and drugs (PDD) in EMRs.
Content
Specifically, we extract important medical entities from MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) and automatically link them with the existing biomedical knowledge graphs, including ICD-9 ontology and DrugBank. The PDD graph presented is accessible on the Web via the SPARQL endpoint, and provides a pathway for medical discovery and applications, such as effective treatment recommendations.
A subgraph of PDD is illustrated in the followng figure to betterunderstand the PDD graph.

Why are school shootings (and death counts) increasing over time?
How does the risk of being killed in a school shooting compare with other risks?
Are some schools / cities / states at higher risk?
Is there a correlation between countermeasures and a decrease in fatalities?
What else correlates with school shooting risks? In addition to firearms and the people who wield them, is there any clear causality?"

For most Natural Language Processing applications, you will want to remove these very frequent words. This is usually done using a list of “stopwords” which has been complied by hand.
This project uses the source texts provided by the African Storybook Project as a corpus and provides a number of tools to extract frequency lists and lists of stopwords from this corpus for the 60+ languages covered by ASP.
Included in this dataset are the following languages:
Afrikaans: stoplist and word frequency
Hausa: stoplist and word frequency
Lugbarati: word frequency only
Lugbarati (Official): word frequency only
Somali: stoplist and word frequency
Sesotho: stoplist and word frequency
Kiswahili: stoplist and word frequency
Yoruba: stoplist and word frequency
isiZulu: stoplist and word frequency
Files are named using the language’s ISO code. For each language, code.txt is the list of stopwords, and code_frequency_list.txt is word frequency information. A list of ISO codes the the languages associated with them may be found in ISO_codes.csv.
This project therefore attempts to fill in the gap in language coverage for African language stoplists by using the freely-available and open-licensed ASP Source project as a corpus. Dual-licensed under CC-BY and Apache-2.0 license. Compiled by Liam Doherty. More information and the scripts used to generate these files are available here.
This dataset is mainly helpful for use during NLP analysis, however there may some interesting insights in the data.
What qualities do stopwords share across languages? Given a novel language, could you predict what its stopwords should be?
What stopwords are shared across languages?
Often, related languages will have words with the same meaning and similar spellings. Can you automatically identify any of these pairs of words?"

(Article II, section 2). This provision, like many others in the Constitution, was born of compromise, and, over the more than two centuries since its adoption, has inspired widely varying interpretations.
The president nominates all federal judges in the judicial branch and specified officers in cabinet-level departments, independent agencies, the military services, the Foreign Service and uniformed civilian services, as well as U.S. attorneys and U.S. marshals. The importance of the position, the qualifications of the nominee, and the prevailing political climate influence the character of the Senate's response to each nomination. Views of the Senate's role range from a narrow construction that the Senate is obligated to confirm unless the nominee is manifestly lacking in character and competence, to a broad interpretation that accords the Senate power to reject for any reason a majority of its members deems appropriate. Just as the president is not required to explain why he selected a particular nominee, neither is the Senate obligated to give reasons for rejecting a nominee.
The confirmation vote records were recorded, compiled, and published by the Office of the Secretary of the Senate."

The dataset files are written as comma-separated values files with a single header row. Columns that contain commas (,) are escaped using double-quotes (""). These files are encoded as UTF-8. If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. MisÃ©rables, Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.
User Ids
MovieLens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized. User ids are consistent between ratings.csv and tags.csv (i.e., the same id refers to the same user across the two files).
Movie Ids
Only movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset. These movie ids are consistent with those used on the MovieLens web site (e.g., id 1 corresponds to the URL https://movielens.org/movies/1). Movie ids are consistent between ratings.csv, tags.csv, movies.csv, and links.csv (i.e., the same id refers to the same movie across these four data files).
Ratings Data File Structure (ratings.csv)
All ratings are contained in the file ratings.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format: userId,movieId,rating,timestamp
The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.
Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).
Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.
Tags Data File Structure (tags.csv)
All tags are contained in the file tags.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:
userId,movieId,tag,timestamp The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.
Tags are user-generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.
Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.
Movies Data File Structure (movies.csv)
Movie information is contained in the file movies.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:
movieId,title,genres Movie titles are entered manually or imported from https://www.themoviedb.org/, and include the year of release in parentheses. Errors and inconsistencies may exist in these titles.
Genres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following: Action Adventure Animation Children's Comedy Crime Documentary
Drama Fantasy Film-Noir Horror Musical Mystery Romance Sci-Fi Thriller War Western
(no genres listed)
Links Data File Structure (links.csv)
Identifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are contained in the file links.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:
movieId,imdbId,tmdbId movieId is an identifier for movies used by https://movielens.org. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link https://movielens.org/movies/1.
imdbId is an identifier for movies used by http://www.imdb.com. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/.
tmdbId is an identifier for movies used by https://www.themoviedb.org. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/862.
Use of the resources listed above is subject to the terms of each provider.
Tag Genome (genome-scores.csv and genome-tags.csv)
This data set includes a current copy of the Tag Genome.
The tag genome is a data structure that contains tag relevance scores for movies. The structure is a dense matrix: each movie in the genome has a value for every tag in the genome.
As described in this article, the tag genome encodes how strongly movies exhibit particular properties represented by tags (atmospheric, thought-provoking, realistic, etc.). The tag genome was computed using a machine learning algorithm on user-contributed content including tags, ratings, and textual reviews.
The genome is split into two files. The file genome-scores.csv contains movie-tag relevance data in the following format:
movieId,tagId,relevance The second file, genome-tags.csv, provides the tag descriptions for the tag IDs in the genome file, in the following format:
tagId,tag The tagId values are generated when the data set is exported, so they may vary from version to version of the MovieLens data sets.
Cross-Validation
Prior versions of the MovieLens dataset included either pre-computed cross-folds or scripts to perform this computation. We no longer bundle either of these features with the dataset, since most modern toolkits provide this as a built-in feature. If you wish to learn about standard approaches to cross-fold computation in the context of recommender systems evaluation, see LensKit for tools, documentation, and open-source code examples."

While studying neural networks in machine learning, I found an ingenious 2-D scatter pattern at the cn231 course by Andrej Karpathy. Decision boundaries for the three classes of points cannot be straight lines. He uses it to compare the behavior of a linear classifier and a neural network classifier. Often, we are content with the percentage of accuracy of our prediction or classification algorithm but a visualization tool helps our intuition about the trends and behavior of the classifier. It was definitely useful to catch something strange in the last example of this description. How does your preferred method or algorithm do with this input?
Content
The 2D scatter train pattern is a collection of 300 points with (X,Y) coordinates where -1<X,Y<1.
The 300 points are divided into 3 classes of 100 points each whose labels are 0, 1 and 2. Each class is an arm in the spiral.
The test file is simply a grid covering a square patch within the (X,Y) coordinate boundaries. The idea is to predict and assign labels to each point and visualize the decision boundaries and class areas.
The train pattern is provided in two formats: libsvm and csv formats. The test pattern is also provided in the above formats.
If you want to reproduce the data yourself or modify parameters, either run the python script in cn231 or you may check PicoNN out for a C++ version.
Here's the output I get with the neural network classifier PicoNN
An SVM classifier with radial basis kernel yields the following output. It looks better than the above neural network one.
An SVM classifier with linear kernel yields the following output. One can see it won't handle curved decision regions.
An SVM classifier with polynomial kernel yields the following output. Interestingly it decided to bundle the center of the spiral.
An SVM classifier with sigmoid kernel yields the following output. There is definitely something going on. A bug in my code? I could had wrongfully discarded this kernel for bad accuracy. Visualization was definitely useful for this case.
Acknowledgements
I thank Andrej Karpathy for making his excellent cn231 machine learning course freely available.
Inspiration
I was happy with the result of the 100-node neural network. I then tested with libsvm obtaining similar results. How do other algorithms do with it? Would you draw yourself a different decision boundary?"

There are a number of space-based instruments that are able to observe solar flares on the Sun; some instruments observe the entire Sun all the time, and some only observe part of the Sun some of the time. We know roughly where flares occur on the Sun but we don't know when they will occur. In this respect solar flares resemble earthquakes on Earth. This dataset is a catalog of which solar flares have been observed by currently operational space-based solar observatories.
It includes that start time and end time of each solar flare from 1 May 2010 to 9 October 2017 and which instrument(s) they were observed by. It was collected by doing a retrospective analysis of the known pointing of seven different instruments with the location and times of 12,455 solar flares.

This dataset represents the first attempted evaluation of how well space-based instrumentation co-ordinate when it comes to observing solar flares. We are particularly interested in understanding how often combinations of instruments co-observe the same flare. The ultimate purpose is to try to find strategies that optimize the scientific return on solar flare data given the limited space-based instrument resources available. More often than not, our greatest understanding of these explosive events come through simultaneous observations made by multiple instruments."

There are many potential applications for HAR, like: elderly monitoring, life log systems for monitoring energy expenditure and for supporting weight-loss programs, and digital assistants for weight lifting exercises.
This human activity recognition research has traditionally focused on discriminating between different activities, i.e. to predict ""which"" activity was performed at a specific point in time (like with the Daily Living Activities dataset above). The approach we propose for the Weight Lifting Exercises dataset is to investigate ""how (well)"" an activity was performed by the wearer. The ""how (well)"" investigation has only received little attention so far, even though it potentially provides useful information for a large variety of applications,such as sports training.
ix young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).
Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure the execution complied to the manner they were supposed to simulate. The exercises were performed by six male participants aged between 20-28 years, with little weight lifting experience. We made sure that all participants could easily simulate the mistakes in a safe and controlled manner by using a relatively light dumbbell (1.25kg).

By means of numerical models you can prove whether a design is safe or not, instead of making a prototype and testing it. This gives you great flexibility to modify parameters and to find a cheaper design that satisfies all the safety requirements.
But when the models are too complex, the numerical simulations can easily last from a few hours to a few days. In addition, during the optimization process you might need a few tens of trials. So in order to simplify the process we can build a simple 'surrogate' model that yields similar results to the original one. Here's when Machine Learning comes in!
6000 numerical simulations (finite element models, FEM). It must be pointed out that there is no noise in the data, that is, if we run again the simulations we'd get the same results. There are 9 input parameters and 4 output results.

We initially defined eight different vehicle classes commonly seen in Indian traffic. Few of these classes were similar while two classes had less number of labeled instances; these were merged into similar looking classes. For example, in our dataset, we had different categories for small car, SUV, and sedan which were merged under the light motor vehicle (LMV) category.
A total of 6319 labeled vehicles are available in the collected dataset. This includes 3294 two-wheelers, 279 heavy motor vehicles (HMV), 2148 cars, and 598 auto-rickshaws. A second dataset was created by merging cars and auto-rickshaws together into light motor vehicle (LMV) class. Approximately 25.2\% of vehicles were occluded."

The next twenty columns contain function_input_X and function_output_X for all integers between 0 and 9 inclusively, where the following rows contains string encoded python floating point numbers after executing the corresponding function. The final column is labeled function_code, and contains a single-line lambda statement elementary mathematical function.

MNIST dataset,An easy-to-use compilation of census data for U.S. education levels,Roy Garrard,2,"Version 1,2017-11-16",education,Other,1 MB,CC0,162 views,29 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-educational-attainment-19952015,"Context
The United States Census Bureau conducts regular surveys to assess education levels in the U.S. These surveys sample participants' highest levels of education (i.e. high school diploma, bachelor's degree, etc.) The attached CSV file aggregates data for the years 1995, 2005, and 2015.
Content
Data is organized into columns representing the survey year, age range, sex of participants, and education level. For example, [1995, 18_24, Male, ...] represents the 1995 survey for men ages 18-24.
It's worth noting that the surveys varied somewhat in granularity. The 2015 survey divided categories more finely (18-24, 25-29, 29-34...) while the 2005 and 1995 surveys were coarser (18-24, 25-34, ...). This could create some distortion depending on the analysis used.

Bitcoin & Altcoins in 2017,Prediction of Angina from healthcare,KagglerSN,2,"Version 1,2018-01-21","news, lifestyles and current affairs",Other,12 KB,Other,95 views,10 downloads,,0 topics,https://www.kaggle.com/snehal1409/predict-angina,"Many women who are initially thought to have angina turn out to have normal coronary angiograms, that is they are found not to have angina after all. A study was carried out to assess the feasibility of a preliminary screening test. For a large number of patients who were thought to have angina, information on a number of possible risk factors was collected and then their subsequent angina status was recorded. The data is available as an R data frame entitled angina and contains the following information:
status: whether woman turns out to have angina (yes/no) age: age of a woman smoke: smoking status (1=current-, 2=ex-, 3=non-smoker) cig: current average number of cigarettes per day hyper: hypertension (1=absent, 2=mild, 3=moderate) angfam: family history of angina (yes/no) myofam: family history of myocardial infarction (yes/no) strokefam: family history of stroke (yes/no) diabetes: does woman have diabetes? (yes/no) Missing values are coded as NA.
The main aim of this study was to try to find out which, if any, of the health variables, are associated with angina and whether some subset of them could be used to help predict the dependent variable angina status. The accompanying document on the `Model selection through backward elimination’ is going to be useful for that purpose. More specifically, it would be helpful to be able to estimate the risk/probability that a woman with a particular combination of these health variables truly has angina. If such a scheme of estimating risks can be constructed, is it likely to be useful? i.e. is it good at predicting whether a woman has angina or not (since the treatment of angina is expensive)? In addition, it would be of interest to estimate the individual effects of important variables. For example, if smoking seems to be a risk factor, then what is the odds of a smoker having angina relative to a non-smoker? What about ex-smokers and light smokers?"

The dataset is acquired from UCI machine learning repository website [13]. The title of the dataset is ‘Crime and Communities’. It is prepared using real data from socio-economic data from 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crimedata from the 1995 FBI UCR [13]. This dataset contains a total number of 147 attributes and 2216 instances.
The per capita crimes variables were calculated using population values included in the 1995 FBI data (which differ from the 1990 Census values).
The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. The crime attributes (N=18) that could be predicted are the 8 crimes considered 'Index Crimes' by the FBI)(Murders, Rape, Robbery, .... ), per capita (actually per 100,000 population) versions of each, and Per Capita Violent Crimes and Per Capita Nonviolent Crimes)

Data available in the dataset may not act as a complete source of information for identifying factors that contribute to more violent and non-violent crimes as many relevant factors may still be missing.
However, I would like to try and answer the following questions answered.
Analyze if number of vacant and occupied houses and the period of time the houses were vacant had contributed to any significant change in violent and non-violent crime rates in communities
How has unemployment changed crime rate(violent and non-violent) in the communities?
Were people from a particular age group more vulnerable to crime?
Does ethnicity play a role in crime rate?
Has education played a role in bringing down the crime rate?"

Centroids for a district are calculated by mapping border of each district as a polygon of latitude/longitude points in a 2D plane and then calculating their mean center.
Centroids for a state are calculated by calculating the weighted mean center of all districts that constitutes a state. The population count is the weight assigned to each district.
The complete code for calculating the centroids and web scraping for the data is shared on GitHub.

SqueezeNet: AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and <0.5MB model size
Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet).

What is a Pre-trained Model?
A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a dataset and contains the weights and biases that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset.
Why use a Pre-trained Model?
Pre-trained models are beneficial to us for many reasons. By using a pre-trained model you are saving time. Someone else has already spent the time and compute resources to learn a lot of features and your model will likely benefit from it."

Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition
In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.

Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition
In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.

What is a Pre-trained Model?
A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a dataset and contains the weights and biases that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset.
Why use a Pre-trained Model?
Pre-trained models are beneficial to us for many reasons. By using a pre-trained model you are saving time. Someone else has already spent the time and compute resources to learn a lot of features and your model will likely benefit from it."

Last Days of the Raj 
A centrally located Indian restaurant, perfect for eating before or after the cinema or a show. In summer enjoy your meal in the beautiful garden. The most popular dishes are lamb and chicken cooked with mild, medium or hot spices. For brave customers there is extra hot!
A Taste of Tuscany
Whether you’d like a great value-for-money lunch or a relaxed evening meal in stylish surroundings, this is the place for you. The chefs have all been trained in Italy and they make both traditional and contemporary dishes. We recommend the pasta and seafood.
Your Local Caff
Remember when cafés served full English breakfasts – sausages, beans, fried bread, bacon and eggs – with a strong cup of tea? Well, this place still does and you can have your breakfast at any time you like during the day while you listen to your favourite tunes from the 1980s. 
The Lemon Tree
This pretty restaurant serves healthy food that’s tasty too. Come in for a vegetarian snack at lunchtime or a great fruit smoothie or a cappuccino and a delicious piece of cake in the afternoon. Food is bought from local producers whenever possible.
Cheesy Bites
A restaurant that only serves cheese, but hundreds of cheeses from many countries and in lots of different forms. They serve reasonably priced lunches but dinner can be expensive. Lovely food and a very elegant dining room, looking onto an amazing flower garden."

However, not so much has been written about the wonderful food that can be found in Britain. Read two texts about food and say what the English eat and what the British food is like. Is there any difference between the English and the British food? The texts are for beginners and for the upper-intermediate level."
,,,,,food and drink,,,,,,,,,"New Year ____________________________________________________•
In China people eat eight, ten or twelve dishes of food at New Year. This is because an even number means double the luck. A lot of the food at New Year has a special meaning. Seaweed means good luck and long noodles mean long life. They eat whole vegetables and don’t use knives to cut things, because this means the end of your good luck.
In Russia there is lots of food on the table so the next year will be happy and plentiful. At 11.59 people open champagne and wait for the clock to strike twelve. Then they make a toast for the New Year. They wish everybody good luck and happiness.
In Spain people eat twelve grapes – one with each chime of the clock at midnight. This brings good luck for the next twelve months. But it is difficult to eat twelve grapes in twelve seconds, so people usually have a mouth full of grapes at the end!
Weddings ____________________________________________________•
Italians eat doughnuts in the shape of bowties for good luck. They also eat sugared almonds when they hope for a baby.
Many years ago in Britain the father of the bride gave the groom ‘honey mead’ (a honey drink) for a whole month. In this way the couple had a month of sweetness and happiness. We have now changed the word to ‘honeymoon’ – the holiday a couple goes on after their wedding.
Birthdays ____________________________________________________•
When a child is born in China, the father gives red eggs to his friends and family – an even number for a girl and an odd number for a boy.
The birthday party started in Europe in the Middle Ages. People were afraid of ghosts and bad spirits on their birthdays. Friends and family came to visit you with presents to stop them.
In Mexico people fill a paper animal with sweets. Children close their eyes and hit the animal until the sweets fall out. Then everybody eats the sweets.

,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"Family is one of Be Strong Families core values, beginning with respect for and appreciation of others no matter how old, how young, where they come from, what they’ve experienced, where they are, how capable they are, how healthy they are, who they love. It extends to individual’s choices of who they call family – what intentional, meaningful relationships they form. Our value of family extends to community and to sisterhood and brotherhood. Although we are united by this value, family means something different to each of us. Hear from our Board of Directors what family means to them:

“My family is and has been supportive in helping me raise my children. They represent the foundation of who I have become in life. It was my aunt and uncle who drove me around looking at colleges as a high school student and encouraging me for higher education. My grandparents financed my college education. My family has always been there for me, in good times and not so good times. If it wasn’t for my mother, I am not sure where I would be today. Since I got divorced 12 years ago, my mother has helped me financially to stay in my home and meet the needs of my growing kids.”

- Nina Aliprandi (Board Chair), Director of Program Services, Maryville Academy
“Family for me represents the foundation of self, and a unity of acceptance, unconditional sacrifices, joy, support and love that is built on a continuum of resilience, and journey in humility from the past, current and future generations.”

How would you feel about a boss who treated you with that much negative guidance, even if it was well intentioned?
The more effective approach is to catch kids doing something right: ""You made your bed without being asked — that's terrific!"" or ""I was watching you play with your sister and you were very patient."" These statements will do more to encourage good behavior over the long run than repeated scoldings.
Make a point of finding something to praise every day. Be generous with rewards — your love, hugs, and compliments can work wonders and are often reward enough. Soon you will find you are ""growing"" more of the behavior you would like to see."

An educated person understands patience, hard work, and sacrifices to meet the ultimatum of life. It solves the problem of anger and hatred among people and fosters the values of tolerance, compromise, selfless deeds, and courage.

,,,,,education,,,,,,,,,"The online school curriculum offered by Education World Wide can also be an online homeschooling program.

The Difference Between Online and Homeschooling
By its definition, homeschooling is the education of children in the home environment by parents. Therefore, it’s not the same as online education. Many parents think these two forms of education are identical, simply because children learn at home. The significant difference is that virtual schools still have to follow educational standards, just like traditional schools. In contrast, homeschooling gives parents more control over the child’s education.

Education World Wide is primarily an online school, however, parents can use our curriculum as a homeschooling program (in a traditional sense of that word). We use an American international curriculum for elementary, middle, and high school. The program holds accreditation forms the North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement.

In addition, this education also benefits an individual in various ways. It helps a person take a better and informed decision with the use of their knowledge. This increases the success rate of a person in life.

Subsequently, education is also responsible for providing with an enhanced lifestyle. It gives you career opportunities that can increase your quality of life.

Similarly, education also helps in making a person independent. When one is educated enough, they won’t have to depend on anyone else for their livelihood. They will be self-sufficient to earn for themselves and lead a good life.

Above all, education also enhances the self-confidence of a person and makes them certain of things in life. When we talk from the countries viewpoint, even then education plays a significant role.

             Whether it's my grandparent, my two sisters, my mom, or my dad, I know I can always count on someone to help me feel better. In fact, I think that this is probably the most important thing that my family has taught me; a family is made up of people who you can trust and who you can count on. Too many times today, we read in the papers about families where parents abuse their children, verbally and physically. What these parents don't realize is that they are either beginning or involving themselves in a vicious circle of hate in families. When parents abuse their children, they are telling their children that that is the way to raise children, and this is what their children learn. I was lucky, I have learned differently, because my family cares about me, and I care about them. 
             In this world of doubt, insecurity, and fear, my family is always there for me, holding their arms open to me with love. On the first day of first grade, I didn't want to go to school, I had butterflies in my stomach and I found it difficult to walk because I was so nervous. The only reason that I finally went into the classroom is because my mom walked in with me, and promised me that as soon as school was out, she'd be there waiting for me, ready to bring me back to where I felt most comfortable, my family. 
             Luckily, I'm a little more grown up now; I can go into school by myself, and in a couple of years, when I go away to college, I'll really have to go to school by myself.

My father is an efficient doctor and my mother is a house wife. All of my brothers and sisters go to same school. My mother takes care of our studies because my father is mostly busy in hospital, treating patients. At weekends, my father spends full time with us.

He is really wise and involved in many adventurous activities. His advice and decisions are always the best. He has taught us all about the things which will help us to become successful in life.

My family is the best family in the whole world. No matter how hard any situation in our life gets, we are always there for each other.  Since childhood, I have seen and admired the bonding between my family. My parents were always there to support and guide us. They are my role model. They taught us that no hardship can break a family that stays united.

They also taught us to have faith and hope. They taught us ethics too and it is because of their good parenting that our family is the best family.

My elder brother and sister have prepared me for the challenges that I will face in my future. All these things have helped me to shape my life in right manner. We all care for each other. We all go for picnic once in a week to spend some quality time together and on vacations, we go for long trips.

We celebrate all festivals together with love and we also give gifts to each other.Even though we are not very rich but our love for each other is enough to keep us happy and it cannot be replaced by anything else in this world.

We have a very peaceful atmosphere at home. After school time, we usually spend our day on studying and playing. All of us have a strong communication between us. After the day we sit together and discuss about our routine. I believe that it is very important to have conversation with family about big or small things.

It keeps a family connected. We all share the burden of each other.I know that after school, I will make new friends at college but none of them will mean to me as much as my dear family.

Conclusion

Family is a very valuable gift of God and we should never take it for granted.I love my family because they have always been there for me in my good and bad times. My family is a blessing in my life.I cannot imagine a happy life without my family. I pray to God to protect my family from all evil eyes and keep us happy."

,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"A family is one of the greatest gift god has given to all living creatures on the earth including humans. It is a privilege to have a happy family as not everyone in the world has it.

The joy of living with your parents, fighting with your siblings over petty can just make you smile the moment you think of it. In order to inculcate the values of a family in the students, we have composed some short essays for students. 
Family is important to every one of us and we all love our family. Wherever we go in this world and whatever we may achieve, our heart and soul will always be in our home because it is where our beautiful family is. Nothing in this world can be stronger than the bonding of the blood. The members of the same family may have differences of opinions, may quarrel often for silly things but in spite of all these it is our family that supports us during our ups and downs."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"As the saying goes, “Family is the best thing you could ever wish for. They are there for you during the ups and downs and love you no matter what”.

Contrary to this saying, we cannot choose our family as we choose our friends. But I can say that I’m blessed with a wonderful family. My family is very small with four members – my mother, my father, my elder sister and me. My family is a middle class family and my father is officially the bread winner of our family. My mother supports him financially by taking tuitions for school children.
We do not have much money or wealth but what my family has in abundance is love for each other which cannot be replaced by anything else in this world. My father and my mother are the role models to my sister and me. They struggle a lot to give us a better life. More than anything they have taught us discipline and morals of life which is helping us to lead our lives in a righteous path even today.
I cannot ask anything more to God since he has already showered me with my family which I treasure the most every second and will safeguard even in the future."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"The family is a valuable god gift which plays a most crucial role in every individual’s life. I love my family very much because all of my family members stand in my good as well as bad times. From moral teachings to love and support, my family has always helped me without any demand. There is no doubt that we experience our biggest triumphs when we really connect to them.

My family is like a strong pillar for me, on which I can rely blindly anytime I require support. From my family, I have learned the social graces of loyalty & cooperation.
My family consists of my grandfather, my grandmother, my mother, my father, two young sisters and myself. My grandparents are the pillars of my family and my grandfather is the head of my family. He is the one whose decision relating to any matter is final and all of us do respect it.

Right from my childhood, my family members have prepared me for the challenges that I’ll face in the years ahead. In addition to this, all of my family members help and serve each other at times of need. These qualities that I have learnt from my family has helped me to shape my adult life in a right manner.
I am really very attached to my grandfather. He holds an excellent life experience because he has already faced so many ups and downs. My Grandfather has helped me to build my perception & vision towards society.

My family has always been there to motivate and encourage me to overcome all difficulties in life and achieve success. The role of every member in my family is unique and important in their own way. I thank God that I have grown up in a family full of love and discipline. My family values will definitely help me in becoming a better person."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"A person without family and its love never becomes completely happy in his/her life. I am complete and happy with my family that includes five members. My family is a group of five including me, father, mother, brother, and sister. Family bonding is a unique type of love that gives you every lesson needed to live a harmonious life.

Growing under the supervision of a caring and loving family will increase our social values and overall well-being. Each member of my family carries out equal responsibility in sculpting the strong bonding needed for a better future and develop moral importance in each other.

My father owns a successful business of office stationery store. He uses the money to cover all our expenses and give a better lifestyle to the family. He works hard day and night to get us better education, food, home, etc. He hides all his tiredness when he comes home after a long day to spend quality time with us.

My mother is a talented homemaker who also does a part-time tailoring at home. She does all her duties with at most interest, from taking care of us to all the household chores and finds time to pursue her passion as well. She is a multi-tasker and does all the tasks from helping us in our studies to preparing delicious healthy foods to sculpt us into a better human being."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"My brother is an engineering graduate and does a job in a well-known company. He is my best well-wisher and helps me in all ups and downs. My sister is also an engineering graduate and an employee in an IT company. She always finds time to help me with all my difficulties and she is my secret keeper too.

My family is a lifeline to whom I can run to, whatever may be the situation I am facing. My family guides me to be a good person and help me in nurturing good values. We, humans, are animals that live together spreading love and care for each other, and this togetherness is called family. The absence of such a divine bonding make us equal to animals.

Family value and growing in such a caring surrounding helps me to pass all the struggles and hardships that I face in my daily life. Whatever be the situation we are facing, our family will never leave us alone. My family is a blessing for me and I value everyone in my family with equal respect and love."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"Most of the people in the world are blessed with having a family. A family, with whom you can share all your joys and sorrows, who is there to guide you through your growing years, who stands by you in the toughest of the situations. I too am blessed to have such a family.

My Family:

My family is one the most bizarre family in the world. We are four people, my mother, my father, my younger brother and me. While my father is the one who does work for a living, it is my mother who is the boss of the house. My father is a humble person. He is an officer in a government department. My mother is a housewife. It is our mother who takes care of our studies as our father is often busy with his official assignments and even travels for days together. We just miss him when he is not at home.

He never scolds us. But, our mother is just the opposite. She wants us to remain disciplined and we often get scolded by her. However, our father comes to our rescue most of the times. My brother, still in school is the one with whom I love to spend my time the most. Not because I love to play with him, but because, being the elder sister, I enjoy instructing him and showing him who is more powerful at home. He, at a time, seems so helpless when our mother says to obey his sister. I just love that moment. But not all days are the same. I hate having to study all along while he gets to play more than me.

The Atmosphere in my Family:

We largely have a peaceful atmosphere at home. After school, our time is spent on studying, playing and watching television, which of course our mother does not like. Unlike other couples, my mother and father seldom have a fight. In fact, as soon we see an argument brewing up, one of them just withdraws and it is just rare to see a heated conversation between them. This is what I like the most about them as I feel that my parents are so cool. It is only me and brother who love to fight with each other.

However, we know that behind those fights, it is actually our love for each other which binds us together. I just enjoy being at home spending time with my parents and my brother. I just feel how bad it would be when tomorrow I and my brother shall move on for our professional lives and we shall not be able to spend much time together. However, it is the memories of today which shall be with me forever and will bring a smile on my face anytime when I feel low.

The Importance of a Family:

A family is said to be the first school of a child. It is from here you start to learn how to speak, walk and interact with the world. It is important to value the importance of a family in one’s life. At times, people feel that they are grown-ups and that their parent’s advice does not matter anymore, but that is not true. It is the elders of the family who at any given of time would know the world better than us and we should all respect our family members and love our siblings as well. It is the family who builds our character and we should feel fortunate to have a family around us."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"My family values are what I take so dear to my heart because they have made me what I am today and I plan on passing these great values to my children in future. Every family has those things, acts and values that they hold in high esteem and they cherish so much. These vales have become a part of them: most times, it is what distinguishes the traits in each family and in some ways it makes or mars the future of the family members. Same applies to my family, we have some set values that has become a part of us and it has made my life a lot better because I have become a better person who is not only valuable to himself but also to the society at large. I will be sharing some of these values with you.

My Family Values:

Some of my family values include:

1. Honesty:

This is a principle that is highly protected in my family. My dad has this saying that, “honesty is the best policy.” Ever since I was little, my family has taught me how to be honest and the benefits that lie within. Sometimes, my parents even test us in ways we were not expecting and a reward is given to the person that comes out honest. This is one of my family values that I cherish so much and I am proud that it is what my family hold in high esteem.

2. Kindness to Others:

This is not a common trait to all. My mom has this belief that if the world and everybody in it shows love and kindness to one another, there will be no hatred and wars will be eradicated. This is a family value that we cherish so much. I learnt to show love to everybody. Even when we did not have much, my parents will still give to those who are needy. My dad says that the world is like a river, we would eventually flow into one another later and you do not know the future, the person you helped today might eventually be of help to you tomorrow.

3. Education:

This is a value that has been passed from generation to generation in my family. My dad would say that education is the best legacy you can give to a child. My family does everything in their capacity for you to get a sound and benefitting education. The acquisition of knowledge is also quite important. All of us try to gain more and more knowledge because we all have a family slogan that says “knowledge is power and that power makes me a hero.”

4. Dress and Appearance:

This is a religious value we cherish in my family. My dad would say that you are addressed the way you dress. I do not want to be address wrongly and give out a wrong impression. So, our appearance really matter a lot to us and the way we dress.

Conclusion:

Every family has one thing or the other that they hold in high esteem and tend to pass on from generation to generation. This is what makes a family a united sect not because we are related by blood but because of we share the same values."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"Introduction:

Why I love my family is a question that has been floating through my mind for a very long time because no matter how hard I try to pin out a reason why I love them, I just can’t find one. This can be due to fact that they mean the whole world to me and I will do anything for them. I love my family a lot and I would like to share some of the reasons why I love my family and will never trade them for anything.

Why I Love My Family:

I have a family that consists of 6 people: my father, my mother and four children which includes me. For you to understand why I love my family I will tell you a little about each of them and why I love them so much.

My father is the best father in the world: well, that’s what I say. He is a business manager. I look up to my father a lot because I will like to take a lot of his behaviours and make it mine. He taught me to be contented with whatever I have. We did not have much when I was growing up; my dad lost his job and still did not allow anything of the pressure change how he behaved to us at home. He is caring, gentle, accommodating and disciplined.

My mum is the best cook in the world. I do not know where I would be today without my mum. I owe her a lot. She is a teacher by profession and this fascinates me a lot because not only is she inculcating knowledge in the young minds of tomorrow, she is also building the future of our society at large. I want to be like my mum. I remember those times when she had to sacrifice when the most precious of her things just to make me happy. She is loving, caring, understanding, accommodating. In fact, she is everything you can ever wish for in a mother.

My elder sisters are the best. Although they can be frustrating sometimes but that is mostly because of my stubbornness. They pretend they do not really care but deep inside they do. The things they do even subconsciously say otherwise. I remember a day in elementary school, I was being bullied a boy in class. On this particular day, he hit me. Unknowing to me, my sister heard about it and she beat the boy and made him apologise to me, I felt so happy that day because I had someone who had my back.

My brother is one of the best gifts I have received. He is the last child and this gives him an opportunity to be annoying if you know what I mean. He is joyful and always ready to heed correction. There was this day, I heard him bragging to his friends about how awesome I am, and I was the happiest that day.

Conclusion:

We all have one reason or the other on why we love our family. I love mine because they are the best gift I could ever ask for and the fact that they have been there for me through the good, bad and funny times."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"Introduction:

Importance of family is something that is greatly overlooked and underrated in the world we live in today. The definition that the family had about one hundred years before now was very clear. Back then, a family was believed to be a unit that consisted of the father that was in charge of the finances of the family, a mother whose primary duty was to look after the home and take care of the children and then there were the children. Largely based on the region you are from, a family can also include members of the extended family like aunts, uncles and grandparents. This type of family system is referred to as joint family.

Family Importance:

A family that is important is one that is very strong. If a family is going to be very strong, there is a need for the bond between them to be very strong. Bonds that help in keeping the members of a family with each other are relationships. If there are very strong relationships among all the members of a family, there is going to be stronger commitment between all of them and the family as a unit will be very important.

Better communication is also a result of family relationships that are very strong. If all the family members can take time out to talk and know each other well, the bond between them is bound to be very strong. Even if the conversations are about big things or small things, it does not really matter. The most important thing is that all family members stay connected to one another. It is very important that they all list to each other and understand every member.

How to make Family Bonds Very Strong:

We have various things that can help our family bond to improve.

A few of them include:

1. Love: love is the most important thing we need for our bonds as a family to improve. When we love the members in our family, we will also be able to know all about privacy, intimacy, caring, belonging and sharing. When there is love in a family, the family will prosper.

2. Loyalty: loyalty is something that comes as a result of love. Family members should stay devoted to each other. It is important that we are able to count on our family to have our back anytime we are facing problems.

Conclusion:

The importance of family can never be overstated even though we live in a different time now and our attitudes to relationships, marriage and what a family should be has changed. The family is something that we need to help share our problems and be there for us anytime we have issues. A lot of the things that were not acceptable in the past and we now see as normal. Even with all the changes that the society has effected on our family system, the family still remains the major foundation of our society and this will remain the same."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"My family is the best gift I have got. A family can be simply said to mean a social group of different people in our society that includes one or more parents and also their children. In a family, every member of the family commits to other members of the family in a mutual relationship. A family is a very important unit and the smallest unit in the society. A family whether a big one or a small one is of very great importance and use to all of its members and is believed to be the unit of our society that is strongest because the society is formed from the coming together and culmination of various families.

In many cultures, the family serves a child’s first school where the child learns all about their traditions and cultures more importantly learn about all the rudimentary values in life. A family is very essential in the teaching of healthy habits and good manners to all the members of the family. It gives the members of the family the opportunity to become people with better character in our society. I feel very lucky to be born into a small and lovely family; I learnt a lot of things from my family.

I am from a middle class and average family with six members (my father, my mother, my grandmother, my grandfather, my younger brother and me). My grandfather is the head of the family and we all respect and listen to him. He is really wise and tries to advise each and every one of us using his many life experiences. He has been involved in many interesting and adventurous activities that he tells me about all the time. Most of the time, he has the final say on all of our family issues and he does his best to make all his decisions impartial.

Any time we are eating today as a family, he sits at the top of the table; we all have designated seats at the dining table. When my brother and I are available, my grandfather teaches us about our traditions and cultures. My grandfather is very friendly and has a cool and great personality and tries to talk nicely and calmly to everyone passing across his message without being rude. He helps my brother and sometimes me with our assignments. He majorly teaches us about all of the tools we need to be successful in life including punctuality, discipline, moral, cleanliness, continuity, honesty, hard work and trustworthiness.

My lovely grandmother is one of the nicest people I know, she tells my brother and I lovely stories every night. My father is a civil engineer and he is very hardworking, sincere and punctual. He is the breadwinner of the family and does his best to provide for every member of the family even if that means he has to work extra hours. My mother is very sweet and takes care of every member of the family even though she works as an accountant at a firm. She wakes up very early in the morning to make preparations for the day. My brother is a funny and jovial person that enjoys sporting activities and I love him so much.

Sometimes I wish my cousins, uncles and aunts lived with us, I love having them around. There are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of having everyone around. I have highlighted some below.
Some advantages are:

1. It gives a better routine of living that can contribute to a proper growth.

2. Having a joint family helps in following the numerous principles of an equitable economy and helps teach discipline and respect. It also teaches us how to share the burden of other family members.

3. There is the understanding of having to adjust to the needs of other family members.

4. The children in a large family get to grow up in a happy environment because they have children of their age around that they can play with.

5. All the members of a joint family are usually very disciplined and responsible as everyone has to follow the instructions of the family head.

Some of the disadvantages include:

1. There is always the chance of a rift or fight between the family members because of the possible imbalance of feelings of oneness, brotherly love and feeling of generosity.

2. There is a chance of the members of the family that earn very high looking down on members of the family that do not."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"Introduction:

The concept of family is important in India for every individual. Family defines an individual background in terms of social relations and growth. Families influence the lives of individuals from childhood to adulthood especially in decisions concerning life milestones like marriage and career paths. Indian families live together for up to four generations under one roof and they manage to maintain lose family relations compared to other families across the globe. Indian families tend to stick to their cultural practices as a family and they maintain religious practices that cut across the family. Elders in Indian families are respected by the members of the family and their opinions are considered during decision making.

What Family Really Means:

Basic knowledge defines a family as a group of people who share genetic and legal bonds. However, the concept of family means a lot more for other people than just the bond and it incorporates the concepts of culture and religion. In India, the concept of family differs from what the rest of the world perceives as family.

Families in India go beyond nuclear and extend to wider circles, whereby the extended family lives together and are closely related. The relationships in the family are strong such that cousins are considered siblings and aunts and uncles are considered parents. Family also means the unconditional love among the members of the family whereby there is support in terms of finances and emotions.

Why the Family is so important:

The family plays a central role in lives of individuals in teaching of moral values. Parents, aunts, uncles and grandparents have been known to teach the children on morality and disciplinary issue s in most cultures. Both spiritual and moral values are instilled through family. Family give a sense of belonging to individuals because they are over by the family and supported at all times.

A family will always support its members with needs including financial and emotional needs. In a family, there has been established levels of satisfaction and happiness from the joy of being together. Families also helping community development through contributions and participating in activities in the community. The family is important in the society in maintaining order, discipline and peace."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"I come from a big family. My family has not moved to an urban area and so we still live as a wider circle together with the extended family. In my nuclear family, I am the first born of four children. I have one sister and two brothers who are still at school. I have three aunts and two uncles. My cousins are twelve in number and most of them are at school except for the youngest ones.

My grandparents are very old and they do not get out of the house much and are being taken care by my parents and aunts. Most of the children are always at school and the house gets quiet but during holiday, we all unite together as a full house. My family is of the middle class in terms of wealth. Our religion is Hindu and we all practice the Indian cultures and traditions. What I love about my family is that everyone is a good cook and the food is always amazing. Members of my family are kind and respectful and that is why we rarely have disputes. The family support is strong and we all love each other."

References to other, older, and extended family members occasionally occur, but usually the family is the focus of the drama. Also, the older relatives, like Grandpa, seem to be in nursing homes, which implies that the family unit perceives itself to be nuclear and does not intend to incorporate other figures into its fold at any point in time.
             What are at least three family roles? 
             Homer is the breadwinner, officially, as Marge does not work for pay. Marge is a kind of gatekeeper, as Homer is often not effective in being fair in his discipline-she reprimands Bart when he does poorly in school, but gently, asks the children to be nice to their father when he is difficult, and makes sure the family comes together most nights to have a nice dinner. The health officer of the family would be Maggie, as Maggie is always concerned about how the family spends its time, eats, and cares about the larger world environment.

             Marge is one of the great family strengths. She is warm and compassionate, always listens to her children, and tries to see things from everyone else's perspective. She is always willing to admit when she is wrong. Another great strength is that the children are very imaginative. Lisa is artistic. She plays the saxophone and is always looking to learn new things about the world. Bart is creative in his own way. Even though he is often getting into mischief, he is always exciting and interesting, and prevents the family from falling into set routines and patterns of behavior.

,,,,,family,,,,,,,,," Parenthood can be a wonderful thing, whether it is the first or fifth child. The value of the family has changed over the years. The traditional family consisted of a wife, husband, and the children. The growing trend nowadays is a father and child or mother and child. The more common of the two is mother and child. There are different situations where parents become a single parent. It could happen because the significant other has left them or worse, they could have passed away. Some people think that single parents always need help. Either they don't pay attention to the children, or that they really don't love the child. I think that the people who assume these things are wrong. I feel that single parents are capable of bring up children just as well as married people, maybe even better. It is possible for a single parent to be financially stable, give enough attention to their children, and are able to love the child with all the love that they can give.
             Most single parents are able to raise children on their annual income. Usually, they would be looking for jobs if the do not have one, when they know they are having a child . If they already have a job they would most likely to begin putting more money in their accounts, so when the child comes into the world they will have clothes, food, and diapers. They can always get help if they do struggle because of bills. Most of the time the parent will need help with getting groceries. The government can help with this; for example, in Texas, there is the LoneStar card, or also called food stamps. Through this card the government gives money to the parent and child to get food and sometimes when they just need money. People use this when they are really struggling to keep up with bills, and put food on the table for the children.

Michael Higgins was a sculptor. In Corning, he made a living chiseling out of marble and granite, angels and saints for the local cemeteries. Unfortunely, work was irregular and the fees were never large enough to support the family (Lader 5).

The first incident of out right rebellion came at the end of her 8th grade year at school. Margaret's teacher scolded her for being three minutes late.

It is painted in white and has four windows decorated with beautiful curtains. By the windows you can appreciate a nice view of some beautiful flowers and trees and our family dogs. On the walls are some family photos like the ones that show where my brother, sister, and I were born, our graduation photos, and some family members, like my grandparents.

,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"  The family format has changed over the years. We now have a vast assortment of different types/groups of families to suit every lifestyle and level of comfort. Today's family could range anywhere from a couple (man and woman, two men or two women) to a couple and one or more children. Since everyone has a different definition of family, no one combination is right or wrong. 
             The ""childless couple"" families of recent times just don't feel the need to become parents due to their own reasoning. Some feel as though their lives are already perfect without the addition of an offspring. They would prefer to devote their time and energy to other things besides raising children. Sometimes, you do find couples that are willing to contribute to the population but unable due to several reasons such as health problems or financial problems. I believe that every couple should experience being a ""childless couple"" prior to bringing a child into a relationship that does not have a strong foundation.
             In ""mother-only"" families, women take the primary responsibility to raise and care for children without the support of a man or other parental figure. Some of the mothers take full responsibility for their children, including financial, emotional and physical support. There are several mothers who choose to raise their children alone because they may be lesbians and not have any romantic involvement with a man or they may not be capable of carrying on a civilized and rational relationship any longer with the child's father. You also find those who feel as though their biological clocks are ticking just want to reproduce with or without a spouse. Goldscheider and Waite noticed that in ""mother-only"" families ""sons don't actually lack the models of ideal 
             men, because these models are amply provided by other male relatives, friends or the media""."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,," A family is a connection among a group of people that provides guidance through trustworthy acceptance, security based on concepts of love and respect, as well as stress that stems from authoritative conflict and conformity. Imagine a world with no families. You are born into society from another person and then sent away to fend for yourself in an unpredictable world. How you survive? Would you have someone to guide you through the early years of your life until you were able to take care of yourself? If this were the case, the person who guided you could then be considered a family member. However, if the person was more like a formal teacher that was there solely to give guidance and not love or affection until you reached a certain age, then it could be more plausible that a world without families could exist. But would society have an empty space where the trust and reliance on families would exist, or would people eventually grow to establish their own close groups, similar to what we now refer to as friendships, that would fill the emotional significance that a family embodies? Families are a necessity in society. Whether or not some people wish that they were not a part of their family, they would still seek the comfort and security that a family provides."

Has anybody gotten an answer they were looking for? If so, was it the answer they expected to hear, and why are there still so many debates over that question? 
             To find an answer let's first look into meaning of the word ""FAMILY"". What is family? Is that an institution? Is it a marriage and kids? Is that a care taking of each other and children? 
             The ""Family"" goes back to aboregenial times. According to Bronislaw Malinowski a union, such as family, was present back then, but understanding of it was a little different from what it is now. As Malinowski stated that concept of the family are: 1) a bounded set of people who recognized one another and who were distinguishable from other like groups; 2) a definite physical space; 3) particular set of emotions.
             Look a little deeper into above arguments, family is the union between 2 people that have a sexual intercourse in order to reproduce. As we learned, it is not necessary marriage, it is just a union between 2 different sexes that might have a sexual relationship beyond their union, but have at least one child together. Such as union need a definite physical space. As far as I understand, this space was needed for the time, the two people could share together. In certain communities man could live with other man at the same house and woman had to live with other women and children below 13. Couples also need a particular set of emotions, which could lead to sexual attraction. But again, it was very common for them to have sexual relationship beyond their family.
             Now a days the same pattern is being used in families. A husband and wife bound themselves in holy matrimony, they are attracted to each other or ""in love"". In most of the cases they have their own place to live, where they set their own rules."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"For the last two decades, Chinese families have gone through a lot of changes. Much of the old structure and many of the old values of the traditional family have been replaced with a modern twist. 
             The stereotyped view of the Chinese family was that of a large family, with several generations and immediate families all living together, being self sufficient, providing child and elderly care. Some of this is no longer true for the modern Chinese family that mainly has a structure of a husband and a wife living with their children, and sometimes with their parents. Only a small number of Chinese families may have relatives living nearby. Because of that the Chinese family no longer performs the function of providing help with child and elderly care. However, we continue to emphasize the values of family and to maintain close family links. There is a strong bond between parents, children, and the other family members. In the Chinese culture, the family is most important. Men continue to have the dominant position in the family with decision making. Today, Chinese women are acquiring equality with men, by contributing to income or labor in the family business. Chinese families still feel that women's roles are primarily for the raising of children and the running of the home. The roles of the mother and the father are still a bit looked at like segregated. The Chinese saying ""The man is responsible for the external and the woman is responsible for the internal"" is still true in many Chinese families. It means that the man's job is to work, earning money for the family, while the woman's job is to take care of the household that the man can enjoy a comfortable and trouble-free family life. Even though today, Chinese women work outside the house, they are still the main people responsible for the care and upbringing of children. But, before Chinese culture became modernized, the women did not work unless necessary."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"The Family is one of the most important social groups we belong to as we grow up and become part of society. It is the place where we learn most of our values and find a belonging. Without our families we would not be the same people we grow up to become. Throughout history, the word family has carried many different meanings. Most people think of a family as a mother, father, and several children, but a family could be almost any group with common characteristics. All of the many different types of families are very important to society as well as the individual as they mature and find a place in life.
             There are several different definitions of the word family in the dictionary. The first definition in the dictionary is, ""kindred, especially one's own spouse, parents, and children"". This definition goes along with the common perception of the traditional family. According to Plumb, the traditional family has in the past served three primary social functions: providing a labor force, the transmission of property, and the education of children, preparing them to start their own family. This had created a cycle which allows humanity to carry on. One family's offspring make there own family and that family's offspring makes their own family and so on and so forth. The children learn the methods that they will use in their life to create their own families. Without the support of this traditional family society could not work because there is no way a child can live and learn on their own. 
             Some say this traditional family is dying and perhaps it is. The structure of the traditional family is still the same but the functions of family have changed. With child labor laws coming into play, children are not as much a part of the labor force as they once were. More emphasis is on the children learning to someday become a part of the labor force. Without the family supporting them they will not be able to receive "

These five lovable characters have been on television entertaining youths for over sixteen excellent seasons. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are the characters who bring magic to animation. They are from Springfield, Kentucky, a friendly little town, in which a crazy story always comes up. The Griffin family from the hit comedy show Family Guy created by Seth MacFarland also has some crazy adventures of their own. Peter, Louis, Meg, Chris, and Stewie are the five main characters, and the show couldn't be what it is without every single one. They are from a little town in New England called Quahog, Rhode Island, a town that is exactly like Springfield.
             The main character in The Simpson's is the father, Homer. Homer simply makes the show, everything he does, and everything he doesn't mean to do is hilarious. He is an obese man, and a constant drinker who always uses his stomach for a brain. He is constantly watching television. He considers it a memb er of the family. He loves his family, although he is abusive to his son Bart, it is used as comic relief. He works at the Nuclear Power Plant, where he is a safety inspector, and after work goes to Moe's Tavern to tie one of his favorite beers on, Duff. He is always up to no good, and always has moronic plans to deal with situations. He isn't the brightest character ever created either. In one episode, his friends explained to him that he was a little slow, by the time he figured out what they were trying to say to him it was the middle of the night and all of his friends had gone home. 
             Bart, the oldest of the Simpson children, is quite a prankster. He loves to create graffiti, and ride his skateboard around town. He is always causing mischief, especially in school. Every episode starts off with Bart writing lines"
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"I live in the city of Highland Park, home to 57,566 residents, predominantly of Latino descent by the 1970's. Highland Park is a historic neighborhood in Northeast Los Angeles. It is inhabited by a variety of ethnic and socioeconomic groups and it is with in these groups that drugs, gangs and violence run rapid. Since the year 2010, Highland Park has seen some revitalization in its neighborhood; due to tougher gang injunctions and restoration of craftsman home. A company who has seen the highs and lows of this community is Optimist Youth and Family Services. Optimist Youth and Family Services opened their doors in 1906 when Mr. & Mrs. Jacob Strickland took in an orphaned nephew to their farm just outside the northern city limits of Los Angeles. Another boy - a ward of the court - arrived in the same year. By 1908 there were 13 boys living on the farm. The Strickland's supported the home by selling dairy products and chickens raised on their farm. He purchased the five-acre Strickland Home for $15,000 and leased it to the Home, planning to deed it to the Home if it proved successful. The farmhouse was enlarged and a dormitory built in 1911. 
             In 1916 the State licensed the Home to care for 25 boys; this number was increased until it reached 57, which was the capacity for quite a few years. In the late 1920's, the Home and local Optimist Clubs began discussing working together. Increasing interest and important financial support from the Optimist and Opti-Mrs. Clubs resulted in changing the name to the Optimist Boys' Home and Ranch in the mid-1930's. During the 40's and 50's, a dining room, kitchen, administration building, chapel, gymnasium and additional dorms were built. During the 60's and 70's, because many of the youngsters in care were victims of divorce, abuse and neglect, it was determined there was a need for a more structured treatment and educational program. Classes were established on grounds for students having"
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,," It is important to be aware that the 1995 legislation is particularly directed at the wellbeing of children and the promotion of primary dispute resolution, and that these are two broad and important areas which are dependent on value systems which may involve a wide divergence of views. In the case of children, significant feelings about parental roles and responsibilities may be influenced by issues related to ethnicity, just as they may often be influenced by gender issues. In the case of mediation and conciliation, there may be a reluctance to engage in private ordering or a fear of avoiding the more formal litigation path, due to beliefs, which are hopefully incorrect, that the alternatives involve ""star chamber like"" or unaccountable procedures. Many of those who have come to Australia from particularly repressive regimes would understandably hold such beliefs, just as many indigenous Australians base their lack of trust in the legal system on past experiences with it. It is obviously most important that there be trust between the various ethnic communities and the legal system in general, and this is particularly important in the area of family law. Fortunately the judges and the courts of this country, unlike those of Nazi Germany, are both independent and above these attitudes and will not be influenced by them in performing their duty.
             Given the centrality of family life to us all, the impacts of law and policy which impinge directly upon the family are particularly significant in a multicultural society such as Australia most undoubtedly is. Not only will laws which stereotype families fail to have meaning for those who fall outside the stereotype, but their impacts will be discriminatory, and consequently unjust. In the environment of family law particularly, the challenge to reflect and respect the cultural diversity of the population is both enormous and vitally important. The obligation is on the Court to provide a"

,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"A father and a mother provide an atmosphere in which to live, grow, and develop. The family culture is established by the parents and instilled in the children during their upbringing. A healthy family, is a family that follows a set of strong morals, stays loyal to one another, cooperates, and works together to avoid household differences. An environment where there is openness amongst family members is ideal because minds that are open are more liable to preventing any anger that their adolescents might express. If these challenges get the best of a family, it has the potential to increase hostility and create remoteness between the adolescents. If a family resolves their disagreements, it can strengthen, enforce the family relationships and have a positive effect on the adolescents. Over the past centuries in the United States, the perfect American family was a father who worked and took care of the finances, a mother who stayed at home taking care of the household responsibilities, children, and making sure they went to school. This was the great family structure in the United States.  Every family from low, middle, and rich class retained this family lifestyle structure. Any deviation from this family structure was normally looked down upon and detested. However, times and social standards have changed dramatically since then.

,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"Family, All descendants of a common ancestor. Or at least that's how Merriam Webster’s dictionary puts it. Family doesn't necessarily mean blood or relatives. Just because friends aren't related to you by blood doesn’t mean you can’t consider them as family. We all have friends that we’ve known our whole life and treat them as they were our own family. Maybe you were the only child who had a particular friend you considered to be like a sister. Maybe you have an uncle who really isn't your uncle. Whatever the case is you would do pretty much anything for them. Friends are just family you choose after all.

For example, I have “cousins” that I'm not related to. Does that make us any less of a family? No. We care for them as they were our own blood. Just recently we went on a family trip with them to Austin. According to “Can Close Friends substitute family?” I am not alone on recruiting friends or non-relatives as family. The author of the article got 305 comments on people who said they also do this. “Even Today's parents seem to embrace honorary designations” (2014, March 19). Some examples of designated members are “auntie” or “uncle”. The article also says, ""Those terms can act as road markers, showing how everyone fits together.”, which makes sense for children. It seems to help their children tell who they can trust and guide them, which ties into The Joy Luck club. So what is an expert's definition of family?“It's people with a secure attachment to your child,”(2014,"

This includes newly-weds without children, gay partners, couples with dependants, single mums or dads with children, siblings living together, and many other variations (What is a family, 2013). A family consists of many variables that work together to form a system. The main functions of a family are to ensure that children are satisfactorily socialised into norms and values, to provide economics support for other family members, to satisfy the emotional love and security in a family and to provide a sense of place and position in the society.…show more content…
In comparison, the number of one-parent families increased by 53%, and couple families without children living with them increased by 33% over the same period. Consequently, over time, couple families with children are forming a smaller proportion of all families 47% of families in 2001, down from 54% in 1986.  



Shifts in the prevalence of different family types within society can be linked to a range of convivial and economic trends. In recent decades, trends in divorce and remarriage have contributed to transmuting numbers of one-parent, step and blended families, just as trends towards delayed childbearing, incremented childlessness and more preponderant longevity have contributed to an incrementation in the number of couple only families. Gregarious changes not only affected the prevalence of different family types, but withal the nature and composition of families. For example, the nature of couple families has transmuted with the incrementation in de facto partnering. The age profile of particular family types (such as couples with children) has shifted, as young people increasingly defer major life events. For example, adolescent adults are remaining in education for longer, gaining economic independence later in life and composing long-term relationships at older ages.

Like other growing problems, one parent families are an important raising situation in the United States. Some everyday struggles and disadvantages are experienced by single parents today. Problems such families have to face can range from expensive day care, economic hardship, hurdles in balancing both home and work, and ability to spend limited quality time with children and finical difficulties (Ambert, 2005). The disadvantage for kids in a one parent family is the absence of a mother or father. Being raised by one parent can have a significant impact on children. I chose the social problem of one parent families because of it’s widespread effects and consequences and that’s rapidly increasing in the United States.
Being a one parent family can be a very emotional process. Different problems and concern may arise when being a one parent family. Not spending enough time with the children when left alone without supervision may spend too much time on the internet which could cause the child exposed to different sights that are restricted. State child care programs help eligible families pay for childcare while they work, attend school, or receiving training.

The family unit has evolved though, and it is far more complex, diverse, dimensional and varies in ethnicity and family members than the status quo. Today, families are made up of same sex parents, adopted children,extended families, children raised by their grandparents, and a growing percentage of women, choosing to be single mothers, and single-mothers chosen by circumstances of life. With more than half of all marriages in the USA ending in divorce, every year millions of children enter a new family structure: the single-parent family. By the year 2000, just over 30% of all children in the USA lived in single-parent homes. Undeniably, there is a distinction between a single-parent  and a two-parent home. With these new statistics, our goal is to understand how the academic outcomes of Latino children raised by single mothers can be improved.

There are two types of families that exist in the modern-day world, the single parent and dual parent families. Much of discussion has been placed on the growth and development of single families and their behaviors towards their children college education. Single families are becoming the norm and the traditional family of dual parents has been reducing over the decades.  The topic on the increasing number of children from single-parent family attending college has been a focus among different scientific scholars. I selected this topic since a lot of the contemporary research has overlooked it. Additionally, I selected this topic since it offers an excellent insight of the shift from the traditional family values of childhood education to the single-family values of children education. This topic tries to examine the absence of one parent in relations to the child’s prospects of joining college. The topic has led me to be aware of the modern views and ideas concerning educating children in college institutions. Moreover, I believe that the topic enlightened me on the educational achievements of children raised in single-parent households compared to those in dual parent households despite the single-family facing several challenges."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"During the years, single parent families have become a more common thing. This is starting to become a problem, because family dynamics can really influence a child’s life. According to studies it affects not only the child but the parents too.

For most people, the home life can affect how you act everyday, this is no different for children and school. The stress from home is shown to affect a child's school life. Research has shown that children that live with a single parent score less than children with two parents, on average, with measurements of educational achievements. The reason why children usually do worse than kids with both parents, is because the single parent must work. Therefore is not home to help with homework. Parents also provide the child with emotional support, encouragement and everyday assistance. So, if there is only one parent, then the child is only receiving half of the previously stated things compared to children with two parents. These things can affect a person at any school level. Over 57 percent of children who live with both parents enter college. Compared to the 32.5 percent of children who have single parents that enter college. This is just one way that single parenting can affect a child's life.\

Another way growing up in a single parent household can affect a child’s life. Some children of single parents tend to develop  some hard feelings towards a parent or in some cases both parents. These feelings include anger, sadness or happiness. A reason why a child might feel  anger is because the may not like one parent for not helping out and being there in their life, or might blame the parent for their challenges in life. They might feel sadness from not be able to have both parents in their life fully. However, they might just find happiness from their parents splitting up. Maybe their parents just weren't not getting along. The happiness may come from the feeling of relief, knowing that their parents can’t argue anymore. Children will take the situation differently. However, no matter which feeling the feel, hardships are to come.

Families that are made up of a single parent and their children is a trend that is now trending on television. The parent of this family is usually shown facing the challenges of single parenthood, working full-time jobs, while also raising two to six children in their household that they also have to maintain. In the earlier shows such as, The Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968) and Full House (1987-1995), these families were never usually shown as going through hard times and facing the challenges of single parents in the shows like The Vampire Diaries (2009-2017) and Paycheck to Paycheck: The Life of Katrina Gilbert (2014). With these viewing of the single parents changing through the years, humor as changed gradually with it. With major changes in television programs, single parent families have gone from happy and loving life to in today’s programs being poor and facing many challenges in the world.

Most kids for whom parental rights have been terminated spend too long in the system as there is a severe shortage of prospective adoptive parents willing to consider adoption from foster care. To deprive a child of the chance of a ""normal"" life completely on the grounds of whether it's a single person or a couple applying to have the chance to adopt seems inhumane because who is to say what their situation will be however many years down the line?

Hobbies are our escape from the real world that makes us forget our worries. Moreover, they make our lives interesting and enjoyable. If we look at it, all our hobbies are very useful for us. They teach us a lot of things about different stuff. They also help in expanding our knowledge.

Benefits of Having a Hobby

In today’s fast and competitive world, we often get time for ourselves. Over time, our schedule gets very dull and monotonous. That is why we need to indulge in something in between to keep our minds fresh and active. What’s better than a hobby for this? One of the main benefits of having a hobby is that it is a major stress-buster. You actually enjoy doing it and it satisfies your soul.
In other words, without a hobby, your life becomes an unhealthy cycle lacking any excitement or spark. Hobbies offer you a great opportunity to take a break and forget the worries of your life. They allow you to explore yourself and realize your potential in different areas.

Moreover, hobbies can also be a source of extra income. For instance, if you like painting, you can actually sell your art to make some extra money. Likewise, if you have a knack for dancing, you may teach dance classes to people on your holidays. This way your hobby a benefit you both spiritually and financially as well."

If I were to pick one favourite hobby of mine out of the many I have, I will definitely pick gardening. I developed a taste for dancing when I was very young. The way my feet moved to the rhythm of the music convinced my parents that I was a born dancer. Dancing is very uplifting as well as economical.

I have always had a love for music and dance. However, I never realized the utter joy they bring to humans. Dancing gives us a lot of exercises. It teaches us to move our body rhythmically and feel the beat of every song. This kind of physical exercise is extremely delightful and enjoyable.

Moreover, dance also taught me how to stay strong and push my limits. I have had many injuries while dancing, too many bruises and cuts but that didn’t stop me from pursuing it further. In fact, it pushes me to do my best and realize my potential more than ever.

I have enrolled in dancing classes because I wish to make my hobby my career. I feel we all should do things which we enjoy doing. Everyone is running after money and in this race, they give up their likings and preferences. I have learned from this race and decided to not take part in it. I wish to take the road less traveled by and take on challenges most people don’t dare to.

In short, my hobby of dancing makes me feel alive and well. It is the only thing I look forward the most to. Thus, I hope to achieve my dream of being a professional dancer and making way for people who wish to make careers out of their hobbies."

Hobbies make us feel rejuvenated and satisfied, even when our lives are going through some disappointing phase. While others have been able to harness the power of their hobbies and converted them to money making ventures, many of us are just contented with the joy and satisfaction we derive from them. Here are few essay examples on My Hobby."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occasions. My love for music can be traced back to when I was a child. There are recorded videos of me as a child becoming hyperactive whenever music was played. I would run to the stereo, turn on the music to full volume and start running around dancing. Anyone who dared touch the sound system would face my wrath. Music was the only thing that could calm me down whenever I cried.

I always have this weird feeling that my destiny is somehow intertwined with music. In my early teenage years, my girlfriends and I would sneak into the garage, where my brother and his band mates kept their musical equipment. Then, we would pluck guitar strings and knock the drums in an effort to compose our favorite songs. I was the lead singer by the way.

Unfortunately for my brother and I, nothing much came out of the practice. It was not just me and my brother, music runs in the whole family. I remember vividly on Friday nights, we used to do karaoke sessions where everyone took turns to sing a song, including our parents. We had these sessions recorded and then sent to our neighbors for analysis.

The winner would get a prize, bought from our individual savings. We saved money on a weekly basis purely for the competition. Needless to say, we were the creepy neighbors next door, but that did not stop me from claiming most of the prizes. Eventually, we outgrew the karaoke sessions and now, I mostly do the listening rather than the singing.

Music gives me the needed refuge whenever I feel like my head is spinning and I just want to shut out everything around me. The good thing about music is that there is music for every occasion and feeling. Whenever I feel depressed, I listen to sad songs. They guide me and keep me company during those trying moments. Whenever I’m happy, I have a collection of party songs that I dance to for hours to amplify the good feeling. The beauty of music is that it can be incorporated with other hobbies. For instance, I love reading a good book, as nice orchestra music is playing in the background.

Another good thing about music is that it is universal. You do not have to understand what the musician is saying for you enjoy it. If it makes you feel good, then it is worth listening to it. I’m naturally open minded when it comes to music. I have an extensive collection of music that transcends across many genres all over the globe. It wouldn’t come as a surprise therefore to find several African songs in my phone that I really rock with and have no idea what they are talking about. However, I connect more with Country and Rock music."

You go away for a few days or weeks and come back fresh and ready to take on challenges of life head on. Travelling to many people is a matter of convenience, rather than a recreation activity. They only travel when they have an issue to attend to. Travelling is also not for escapists, as many people tend to believe. I used the word ‘escapists’ not in the literary sense of the word, but rather to mean people who run away from their problems. Travelling is a hobby like any other.

Most people do not understand how moving from one place to another can be categorized together with fun activities like watching movies, swimming, dancing or drawing. While it has more challenges than other hobbies, it is more adventurous and brings the same level of satisfaction or more for those who love it.

Travelling has always been part of our family tradition. My parents taught us from an early age the value of taking vacations at least once a year. Though they wished we could go for many trips annually, we were not well off financially and my parents had to work creatively with the little they had, sometimes saving the whole year for a single trip. We could have used credit cards, but that would have only plunged us into more financial woes. My father was very strict when it came to finances and he cautioned us against using debt to purchase luxuries. If we wanted something, then it was up to us to find creative and legal ways of making money to purchase it.

Although we didn’t have much, money was never an excuse for him. My parents found creative ways to work within the budget. For instance, we would drive to our destination instead of flying and we would carry my mom’s homemade meals. Rarely did we use credit cards and if we did, it was a matter of life and death. Therefore, most of our vacations were during the December holidays. Those were the best days of my life. They were also the days that our family bonds were strengthened. We would fight and quarrel, but in the end we always came back together and worked things out.

From those trips, we learnt more about life than the years we spent at home. What I have just stated may seem farfetched to a person who does not travel much, considering the brevity of vacations, but the reality is vacations never go as planned. Vacations are far from the normal life routines of waking up in the morning, going to work/school and coming back home in the evening. In vacations, there are many risks involved. You are in a foreign land with new people and culture. You have to work with the little funds you have to make the trip as entertaining as possible, but with some level of constraint, so that your family is not stranded.

The beauty of travelling is that you can never really outgrow it. I still do vacations as an adult, although my reasons may be slightly different from my parents. Apart from the obvious reason of having a good time and distracting my mind from the daily hassles, vacations release ‘creative juices’ in me. Working as a writer, I tend to feel burnt out living in the same environment for too long. Sometimes, I need a change of scenery for my artistry to see the light of day. It is a known fact in the literary world that most of the best writers had their best ideas in foreign lands.

I occasionally go for vacations for the sole reason of learning different cultures and interacting with different people to get ideas for my literary work. Furthermore, being away from home really makes you appreciate it even more. The feeling you get after a vacation when you settle down on your couch and just relax is priceless. Travelling makes you appreciate people, their cultures and above all, it makes you appreciate your life and the little you have."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"I’m passionate about reading. Although I have several hobbies, such as watching movies and hiking, reading books is what resonates well with me. There are many reasons why I love reading. The first reason is it gives me a level of fulfillment. That is, books rejuvenate me. After reading a book, I feel like a whole new being and my outlook in life changes.

The second reason is books make my mind sharp. It is a known fact that books improve our brain muscles. They make us think better and improve our decision making abilities. I find it funny that whenever I utter a clever quote from a book, everyone around me would be dumbfounded.

Furthermore, books are very wide and detailed. It seems like there is a book for anything you can think of. If you want religious books, there is the Bible, the Quran and other spiritual books. There are financial books, inspirational books, cooking books, business-related books, biographies, fictional and non-fictional- the list is endless. Reading is actually among the few hobbies that you learn while doing it.

Due to my widely acquired knowledge from books, I find it easy to jumpstart a conversation with a stranger. I realized that people are more responsive when you engage them in topics they are familiar with. This is where I have an upper hand over other people, because I’m quite knowledgeable in many sphere of life thanks to books.

While most people find reading an upheaval task, reading to me is like a calling. It just comes naturally to me. I have made it my culture to read at least a chapter before I hit the sack. Sometimes I read late into the night, especially during the weekends and I only stop when my head becomes too drowsy to continue. My reading culture is further heightened by my introversion.

Most of my ‘me-time’ is actually spent on reading. This is how I get my energy back. The outside can be too overwhelming for some of us. Whenever I feel like my energy has been milked dry by the outside world, I just take a few hours of reading to rekindle my spirits again."

,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"My hobby is traveling. Not for such a long time in my life I have had to travel quite a lot. Why do I like this kind of activity? Well, this question is both simple and complex, as a hobby in the life of every human being arises from the specific life circumstances. Traveling is a hobby of mine for a number of reasons. Firstly, when traveling, you can learn a lot.

When people live in one place and is engaged in all the time the same business, he too gets used to his life, to what surrounds it. He begins to think that somehow did not happen. During the trip, you can dispel this belief. When a person travels, he sees other people’s lives, their way of life, begins to understand their philosophy.

This expands the world of the man himself, forcing him to look at the world through different eyes and become spiritually richer. Secondly, the trip to help check their own forces, very often, they are a kind of test for the human. For example, it is no secret that during some traveling man faces some domestic problems, which can be difficult to overcome. But this definitely needs to overcome, because thanks to him a person receives an extremely valuable experience, becoming more intelligent, skillful, and the like.

Third, after travel, I always feel that I do not live in vain. It seems to me that the more places in the world I will visit, the more I live and fulfilling. However, I am aware that this is more of my personal and subjective.

I never chose a hobby and did not aspire to, to pick up in his capacity as something popular or widespread. It so happened that travel is a hobby for many people. I take this absolutely calm and understanding. I know how to enjoy their hobby and enjoy life as a whole, and I am convinced that it is right. So writing is a hobby."

I liked to portray on a sheet of something beautiful, plants, animals, and sometimes humans. So I often do myself cards for mom and dad. However, my first drawings were not the best. Something crooked, something did not work. But I always continued to paint.

I am learning to draw from different websites, tutorials, and instructors on YouTube. I am keen to draw something that brings the attention of art lovers from around the world.

I love colors so when I wake up early in the morning I keep gazing the beauty of nature around me like trees, birds and everything around me. I love to go to art galleries and see the paintings from different angles and dimensions.

Now, it seems to me, I paint very well. My works are hanging on the walls in my room. I often send their works to the contest of children’s drawings and often receive diplomas and prizes. Moreover, I go to art school. I really like it there. In art school reigns true skill and creativity atmosphere. We usually draw a still life, sometimes people. In the summer we go to the open-air and paint nature, flowers, forests, trees, houses. Now my drawings quite good.

To protect my small plants against diseases I consult with gardening experts here in my city. Apart from that, I have raised an iron fence to protect my plants from animals.

Gardening is not an easy activity, especially when you are a newbie in it. Apart from your core interest, good gardening is dependent upon certain factors. It requires a well nourishing soil that helps plants grow smoothly. A dirty and dry soil is quite difficult for gardening. You have to give water to it and add healthy manure and fertilizers to make it nourishing and healthy.

Secondly, gardening requires you to chose the plant breeds wisely. As per your soil and climate needs, decide what you need to plant. You can easily find plants sapling from the market. Be careful of buying healthy sapling to plant because you are going to invest your time and passion in that. After all of these, you have to take strict care of these plants until they grow good.

Gardening is one of the sweetest hobbies one must-have. It makes you relieve stress and anxiety. However tired, tensed and worried you are, you will feel relaxation and happiness inside the garden.

I have compiled of my travel experiences around these different places. This serves me a good memory that I enjoy watching in my free time.

Traveling is a wonderful and healthy activity. It has a lot of physical and mental benefits. It adds knowledge, experience and adds more learning. Though it is a bit expensive hobby yet is recommended for a man to travel to different new location once a year at least. It would help a man to stay focused and satisfied in one’s life."

Apart from Sachin, I am a huge fan of Ms Dhoni, Virat Kolhi, Rahul Dravid, Rahul Sharma, and other hitter and great bowlers of our country. We all love them because they are our pride when the beat other countries in cricket.

We can enrol ourselves in special classes that will teach us more about our interests. We can choose to do this at our home in our free time.

I’m a fangirl, which means I support all that kind of stuff: boy bands, bands, youtubers, etc etc. even books or series, when you are a fangirl or fanboy you create social accounts, they help you to know people from all over the world who share things in common with you. I’ve known too many people -well, not that much, but yes, a couple of people- it’s fantastic! Now this leads us to another thing that I enjoy to do and it is to socialize. I love making friends, talking to people, etc. I can be a little shy at first depending on my mood, but when you get to know me I’m a very different person.

Now, let’s go to a more interesting topic: Future. Uy! “Future” that’s sounds scary, why? I’m very anxious and I feel like I’m not going to make it. I’m really scared at the time to be honest, but oh well...stuff happens and who knows? Maybe I’ll make it with the weirdest luck that I have. Anyway, when I think about my future I just can think about my three choices, which are: 3D Animation, Cosmetologist and Psychologist; at the time I go more for Psychology, although 3D Animation is a good one too, I don’t know, I’ll let time decide what I has for me, by now I will focus on asking for College info and Scholarships, thank you.

For instance, me and my friends will go on vacation and first thing we had to make sure to bring was the soccer ball.
Soccer is unlike other sports that requires so many equipment because all you really need is just cleat and a soccer ball.
The world cup is one thing that all soccer fans wait for it every four years, me and my friends always get together to watch it and we will be going to the stadium sometimes if we can afford it.
The reason Soccer is the most popular game in the world because it is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries.
One of the things I learned from soccer, the game is not over till the whistle blows, meaning you must work hard and do not give up until the last moment. 
My favorite player is Ronaldo, and one of his famous words is work hard in the dark and one day you may shine under the lights.
Soccer is not just a game, it is a passion, if you do not breath or dream soccer, then you are just wearing a jersey.
Therefore, soccer is without any doubt in my mind the best sport because it is fun, you work out and you shar exciting moments with friends.

I swore I would never drink that stuff ever again. Who would have known that many years later that boozy concoction called “Hard Cider” would become the new and trendy drink? It is without a doubt, the Nectar of the Gods. My favorite hobby is micro brewing beer. I have been producing craft beer for five years now. Half of my two –car garage is in reality, a kitchen with dozens of pots, pan, tanks, fermentation chambers and burners, all sorts of wicked machinery staged about the place to produce fermented beverages. I recently read in some beer journals that cider is making a comeback in the craft brewing market. The idea of producing this sweet drink motivated me to try my own recipe. After all, how could I go wrong since I had the experience brewing beer? So I decided, without much experience, to give it a shot. I rounded up the ingredients; three kinds of apple juice, lots of sugar, and some Champagne Yeast. I heated the juice into a stockpot to kill any germs or other nasties that may be in it. After it cooled. I added a ton of brown sugar and poured into the yeast. I thought, what could go wrong; this stuff looks and smells amazing.

,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"As a student, I am quite busy on weekdays. However, at weekends, I have much free time, so I usually spend it on relaxing to prepare for a coming busy week. First of all, in my free time, I like playing some sports, such as soccer, badminton or basketball, with my friends. Sport not only makes me stronger but also connects me with my friends who have the same hobbies. We sometimes go riding in order that we can combine sporting activity and sightseeing. If the weather is not fine enough for me to hang out with my friends, I like to read books. I have a big bookshelf with many kinds of books but I prefer science books. Through these books, my knowledge is gradually enlarged. Thirdly, I also love to listen to music from pop, rock 'n roll to rap or melody. I can listen to music at any place with a small but modern Ipod which is my father's gift for my 18th birthday. Sometimes, I dance freely when listening to my favorite songs. Music really paints my life. Last but not least, I spend my free time on surfing on Internet. I can chat with my friends from very far distance or log on websites to read online news. With Internet, I update many things without having to go anywhere. I can also study English through some interesting websites. (If I have very difficult exercises and cannot solve them by myself, I will visit Google Answers and have somebody to help me. Just like this one ^^). In conclusion, I want to use all of my free time to relax and connect with other people."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"Nowadays, some people consider that children have too much leisure time and in spite of wasting it, they should use it to do more school work. In my opinion, I think children should use their free time wisely to develop their skills not only in school work but also in their life. Firstly, we all know that people cannot keep on working all the time. We need to stop and relax ourselves. And after a long day in school, children also need to relax. In their free time, they can play games, have a small party or even talk to each other to refresh their mind and keep themselves away from the stressful atmosphere of the school. The games or sports that I play make me more reflexive, faster, and stronger both physically and mentally. For example in tennis, the player has to run, focus on the ball and swing the bat accurately at the same time. Children can improve their body, their reflections and their brain at the same time. Another thing that I do in my free time is pottering around in the garden with my mother. She plants a fair bit of flowers and I enjoy helping her take care of them. It is a pleasure to feel the soil, prune the plants, remove the weeds and do the little things that help the plants grow better. It always fills me with wonder to watch seedlings germinate, leaves sprout and eventually grow to produce beautiful flowers. Social skills play an important part in me daily life. People do not need to be good at their knowledge but they also need know how deal with people. With a large amount of free time, I have joined some social activities which can give me a lot of ideas about the right manners and attitudes for my future life. At night, I usually do a bit of reading before going to bed. Books are like little treasure chests. A lot of information and knowledge are to be found in them and all it takes is a bit of time spent reading them. This is certainly a very beneficial way to spend my free time. After a spot of reading, it is time for bed and on to another day. Mauwaz Ahmed"

WHAT do we teenagers do in our spare time? Hang round by shops with our hoods up, knifes in pocket, shouting abuse and getting drunk? Yes, all those grown ups would like to think that but, we normally just go out to have fun - go to the cinema, shopping and places like that! Or we are on Facebook. We will spend our lives, sharing our lives, on Facebook. From posting pictures, writing statuses, and joining funny yet sometimes offensive groups or fan pages. But, have you ever thought, that maybe, you could get into heaps of trouble from those little comments? Facebook can get quite abusive. With us posting pictures, which, yes, aren't very modest of ourselves, with skimpy outfits, and slapped-on make-up. But the nasty comments, are where we draw the line. Consider this, once it's on there, will your digital footprint ever be erased?

At the moment 35 million Facebook users update their status each day, this shows how popular it is. The site's publicity and popularity levels are soaring, but over the past four years another site has had quite a bit of the spotlight too.

,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"Free time is when all my homework and chores have been done for the day and I am ""free"" to do things that I enjoy doing.

Usually I spend time watching television. As my favorite TV shows come on at specific times, I make sure that I finish my homework and chores well before the shows. Otherwise I will have to miss them. Mostly I manage to watch the shows but sometimes extra homework or chores may cause me to miss a show or two, but it is rare. Anyhow if I know that I am definitely not able to catch a show in time, I will just set the video recorder to tape the show so that I can watch it later.

Another thing that I do in my free time is potter around in the garden with my mother. She plants a fair bit of flowers and I enjoy helping her take care of them. It is a pleasure to feel the soil, prune the plants, remove the weeds and do the little things that help the plants grow better. It always fills me with wonder to watch seedlings germinate, sprout leaves and eventually grow to produce beautiful flowers.

Pottering around in the garden also taught me many things about the insects, butterflies, snails, caterpillars, centipedes, millipedes and other small creatures that inhabit the place. These creatures are mainly harmless and watching them go about their 'chores' always fascinates me.

In the evening when the weather is fine, i sometimes go for a stroll around the neighborhood with my friends. This is the time when most the neighbors have come home from work or school. We say hello to those whom we know. They are mostly friendly people and they acknowledge our greetings. Once in a while we come upon unfriendly neighbors but we just ignore them and carry on.

leisure activities",,,,,,,,,"Leisure or free time is a period of time spent out of work and domestic activity. It is also the period of recreational time before or after compulsory activities such as eating and sleeping, going to work or running a business, attending school and doing homework or housework. Leisure time is the time when you can forget about day-to-day stress and stressful activities and relax. These activities can be our hobby.

Nowadays people work all day long and rarely have spare time to rest and to do something they like. But if they have it they try to spend it in the way they prefer. And there are a lot of possibilities to do it perfect. There are plenty of things to do that can help you not to feel bored. Any activity is much better than doing nothing.

I'd like to notice that there are two main ways of spending free time: the one is to do some physical activities (often outdoors), for example, football, swimming, hockey, skiing; and another way is to enjoy something relaxing at home or in special places: reading, watching TV, knitting, engaging in hand-made. At any rate, hobby is a matter of taste, and everybody should choose it according to the personal preferences.

As for me, I like to pass my leisure time both in active and passive way. I really enjoy reading or watching films, because it's always interesting, helpful and helps to relax, what is especially necessary after a long tiring day. Also I am fond of active sports, swimming, skiing or riding a bike from time to time, when it is possible. Sometimes you feel you need to escape from everyday worries and to do something no thought-provoking. In many cases I can't let me doing anything very extraordinary, so I just go walking over long distances. It really helps to release the tension and refresh the mind.

To the point, the way how people pass their free time depends on the culture and social status. For example, American favorite leisure activity now is participating in experiences that they know aren't real, they turn to imagination – to worlds created by others, such as books, games, movies and television. Also public researches show that the average amount of weekly free time of many people fell; while the average amount of time spent working is now up. It can be explained by the fact of extra time spent on mobile phones or computers, and infrastructure development (the problem of traffic gems in big cities). As well, preferences of people to spend their time have also changed over the past years: instead of team activities more and more people choose solo activities.

Anyway, in the life of any person there are periods of time when he feels extremely bored. It happens because this person doesn't know what to do with his time and can't find anything interesting to do, or because he doesn't like what he is doing. Well, this problem has hundreds ways of solution. The simplest is to find something interesting to do. Here are some variants of activities to choose:
- Just tidy up;
- Try new recipes;
- Decide on making candles, knitting, cross snitching - in one word, create something new you can be proud of;
- Don't let online games dominate in your life;
- Photography, drawing, painting, playing musical instruments are very special activities that you can do as a cure fore boredom;
- Communicate more with other interesting people;
- Read something exiting, encouraging, or anything that will enrich your knowledge;
- Join a health club or gum where you will be able to feel happy and keep fit;
- Go out with your friends;
- Set your aims and keep a diary.

Following these simple advices you will never have a time to think about such problem as boredom.

As we all know, leisure time is one of the most important thing people can't live without. It is a big part of our life, and it actually shows the character and temper of person. I can't imagine a person who doesn't have any hobbies and favorite activities, because it is really impossible. Our hobbies and habits make our lives, filling it up with variety of feelings and emotions. Each person chooses his own way of spending time, either active of passive, and in any case in should be a refreshment and a source of inspiration.

Sometimes I go with my father to the lake to catch fish. The lake is frozen so we must first sit inside our log cabin on the lake and dig a hole in the ice. And through this hole we can fish. I love spending such time with my father or my friends.

On vacation last year, my father told us about the importance of volunteering in charitable work and participating in social activities through which we can help others.

Therefore, we have some activities that we do whenever the opportunity arises, especially on vacations and holidays. Such as volunteering in hygiene campaigns and preserving the environment. Or visits to hospitals and provide psychological support to the patient.

So there is always a new person we get to know and try to make happy, or there is an area we share and work to improve the general appearance of it.

We often work on the sides of roads and rivers where some people throw rubbish there. Therefore, we share hygiene and hang awareness banners in these areas.


 
Sometimes we distribute some warning leaflets to them to preserve the environment in which they live. I love doing these activities very much and I hope they will manage.

Sometimes we go to parties to have fun.

But in recent weeks, that seemed to change a little, as I became involved in voluntary activities after joining a non-governmental charitable organization, which is interested in visiting orphaned children, children with burns, and children with cancer.

Since I joined this association, I no longer care about games as much as before. I work on picking positive words during conversation and showing love through jokes and hiding the side of pity that I used to show when I saw them, I knew that it was bad and made them upset.

I think after joining this association and doing some volunteer work with them that something has changed in me. I feel that I have become more mature and I love the volunteer work through which we raise the morale of many children who need this support."

I love visiting natural areas and photographing some close-up shots of birds or people. I always go around looking for a special shot or an impressive scene that I can capture without affecting its beauty to be natural and unique.

I like to post my photos to my social media accounts. It gets a lot of praise and encouragement. When I grow up I hope to be this is my job."

Leisure time

During life, man needs to spend many times in carrying out the necessary tasks required of him to implement them. After completing these works, he has leisure time, ranging from one person to another depending on the different situations and actions that people do in their day and night.

Leisure is a real blessing for those who use it well. It is a vengeance for those who live in a messy life, filled with illiteracy, a life that destroys the man and makes him live into misery.

The first step in investing leisure time in the right way is to define a goal or a set of clearly defined goals that a person seeks to achieve during his life.

These goals are the main motive that drives the person to set priorities to build his character, organize his time, exploit his abilities, and so on, Which ultimately makes it possible to view leisure as a blessing, not just a time to be filled with any activity.

Man must also use his free time to practice his hobbies and set a schedule for these hobbies at this time. The hobbies keep people away from bad companions, and the different kinds of deviations that may destroy the human, and hinder him from completing his life, and wasting his time in vain.

Taking care of the spiritual aspects, and trying to use leisure time to develop these aspects is the best way to exploit leisure time.

Attention to these aspects helps the human to rise and achieve the highest human grades. It is also necessary to pay attention in leisure time to the social aspects that need to be followed, especially that man is a social being by nature."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"Each person has his hobby and as a matter of fact little free time to do something we like doing most of all. I also have many hobbies. As I am a pupil I haven`t got much free time during the school days. In my free time I usually hang out with my friends or surf the Net. If it is summer I don`t use the computer much and have a great time outside. But in autumn, winter and spring I have to use computer more because sometimes wecan`t do our homework without using the Internet. And I usually chat with my friends because I don`t see some of them for a long time.On Saturdays or Sundays I usually help my mum with the housework, watch TV, meet my friends and often play the guitar because I`m mad about music.But sometimes if the school days were busy and I had to study much harder I simply relax. I think we must do something interesting in our free time because we become borried and tired after doing homework and studying so hard."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"People in society have different hobbies or pastimes to enjoy themselves in their leisure (free) time. Some people, for example, like to play games, some like to go for a walk, some like to watch films, and so on.

Good hobbies or pastimes can help us to improve the body and the mind. For the improvement of the body and health, we may have the hobbies of playing games outside on playgrounds. We can also have the hobbies of swimming, running, walking over long distances, and so on. Morning and evening walk every day give a lot of exercise to the body. Gardening keeps us in contact with nature and fresh air and makes us active.

For the improvement of the mind, we can have hobbies like reading good and useful books, visiting historical places, watching films which increase (add to) our knowledge of the sciences and the arts. The hobby of reading books on the sciences, history and general knowledge is of much use. So the hobby of reading newspapers every day is of great benefit.

Some harmful hobbies are playing cards for a long time, watching all manner of films very often, listening to bad films songs, reading bad books, and so on. We enjoy these hobbies while sitting and cannot take exercise. Bad films and writings harm our thinking and character.

No doubt hobbies help us to pass our free time happily (without being bored) and make us forget all our troubles, worries and problems. Some hobbies increase our knowledge as well as entertain us, For example, through writing letters to pen friends in other cities or foreign countries, we learn about other places. We feel happy while informing others about our city, village or country. Stamp collecting is another such hobby. Through it, we.come to know about different countries and cultures and enjoy exchanging stamps.

Hobbies make life charming and add to our happiness. They bring us new friends and make us social."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"A hobby can be defined as a pursuit which one undertakes in leisure for pleasure and not for profit. The hobby does not aim at earning any money, though sometimes, it may indirectly bring about financial benefit. A man engaged in the collection of stamps may unknowingly collect a few rare stamps which may bring him money. Hobbies reflect the life and personality of a person and give us an insight into the temperaments, tastes and propensities of the people. Life in the modern age has become monotonous, dreary and dull and hobbies provide the required change from the drudgery of routine life and serve the purpose of a refreshing change. The fever and fret of our life is forgotten, though maybe for a short time when one is engaged in a hobby.

Reading fiction and journals, stamp-collecting, coin-collecting, painting, fishing, photography, writing to penfriends are some of the popular hobbies. Collecting autographs of celebrities, boating, playing golf, cricket and other games are also the hobbies of some persons. Gardening is more or less confined to rural areas as there is hardly any place left for this hobby in the urban areas.

Hunting, which used to be a very popular hobby in the olden days, when means of entertainment were very few and far between, has been given up as it involved the killing of innocent animals."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"Some of the popular hobbies among women are social work, knitting, stitching, crochet-work though some women indulge in negative hobbies of rumor-mongering and scandalmongering.

As it is rightly said that an idle man’s brain is the devil’s workshop, one should not remain idle and hobbies should fill up one’s leisure which can serve as a welcome interlude in the tedium of one’s daily life. Recreation is not the only aim of hobbies which give us the knowledge we don’t get from textbooks. Besides serving as mental tonics hobbies are an excellent way of spending one’s leisure.

One should pursue only those hobbies which are useful such as gardening, photography, riding, swimming; yachting as they enable us to use our leisure in a harmless way; while hobbies such as gambling, drinking and cards playing which do not promote real happiness, should be discarded. Besides scandalmongering, character assassination, rumourmongering are very dangerous and can create many enemies for us.

People living in big cities often visit picnic spots and places in the lap of Nature to refresh themselves. It is disheartening that most people in our country do not use their leisure in a proper manner. There are some whose leisure is spent in an unplanned manner while there are others whose leisure is utilized in supplementing their meager income. The life for the poor is a nightmarish experience. Most of us waste our leisure in visiting friends and watching useless movies. It is also equally regrettable that some college students spend their leisure in watching cheap movies and reading pornographic fiction which corrupts their minds and deprives them of any useful pursuit.

There is no doubt that hobbies are the best means of spending leisure and useful hobbies can certainly keep people away from evil ways of life. They channelize the exuberance, enthusiasm and energy of the young and can go a long way in solving many complex problems. Hobby should not be converted into a dull dreary task but should be treated as a mental pastime. Regular work should not be ignored for the sake of a hobby."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"Spare time should be spent in some good hobby. It gives us joy and peace of mind. It protects us from idleness and boredom. Different persons like different hobbies. A good hobby prevents us from many evils. Games and hobbies are different from professional work. They make our life worth living. They are a healthy way of spending our free time. If a man has free time, he starts thinking about his worries and responsibilities of life. In this way, his mind will get no relief from the worries of life. Hobbies and games develop those qualities, which are essential for our health.

There are different kinds of hobbies such as gardening pen-friendship, coin collecting, stamp collecting, photography and music etc. Everybody should adopt a hobby according to his own taste and circumstances of life. The hobby which I like most

is gardening. Fortunately, I live in a house which has an open area in front of it. I have changed it into a beautiful lawn which is surrounded by fruit plants and flowerbeds. One corner of my garden is reserved for growing vegetables. Thus my hobby is also useful for my family because they get fresh and free vegetables as well as fruit in every season. My house has become my paradise.
My hobby keeps me fit, healthy, active and energetic. I daily spend one or two hours in my garden in the evening. It gives a feeling of freshness to my mind and body so that I can study at night wholeheartedly. It also keeps me away from bad company.

My hobby has made me a great lover of nature. The beautiful flowers of various colors and the sweet smell coming out of them have made the atmosphere of our house very soothing. My garden has increased the beauty of our house. I enjoy to sit in the lawn of our house and take evening tea there. All the friends and relatives are admirers of the beauty of my garden. They praise my hobby. I like to study in my garden. Gardening is a useful hobby and I recommend it to all of my friends."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"A pleasant activity which we do to spend our leisure is called a hobby.

“A hobby is an alternative mental interest”
We are busy in our hectic daily routine. Everybody has to work from dawn to dusk. So we need a diversion from our day’s tiresome job. In this regard, pleasant activities give us joy and peace of mind. They protect us from idleness and boredom.

Let the mind some relaxation take to come back to its task with the fresher head.
There are different kinds of hobbies such as gardening, pen-friendship, coin collecting, stamp collecting, photography, music etc. Different people adopt different hobbies according to their taste, income and social setup. My hobby is different from others. I love gardening.
It is said:

God Himself first planted a garden and it is the purest of human pleasure.
Fortunately, I live in a house which has an open area in front of it. I have changed it into a beautiful lawn. It is surrounded by fruit plants. There are also different kinds of plants and trees in it. I have bought them from the nursery. It costs a lot but I can afford it.

I have learned to seek my happiness by limiting my desires rather than in attempting to satisfy them.
There are also flower beds around the lawn. Each bed contains different kinds of flower trees. The lawn is surrounded by hedges. There are four cypress trees one in each corner. All kinds of flower plants have been planted in this garden. There are roses, lilies and jasmines. They present a colorful show to the viewers. They blossom and spread their fragrance all around. Keats has rightly said about trees.

Oh! Happy, happy, boughs
That cannot shed your leaves
Not ever bid the spring adieu
One corner of my garden is reserved for growing vegetables. Thus my hobby is also useful for my family because they get fresh and free vegetable as well as fruit in every season. My house has become my paradize. I daily devote some of my time for the maintenance of my garden. I dig the beds of flowers, trim the grass and apply manure to plants.


 
After my college time, I sit in my garden and study in the shade of trees. It is a source of peace and joy for me.
Sweet is the pleasure after pain!
My hobby offers a very beautiful sight. The dancing flowers, the green grass with dew drops on it and the moving leaves of trees have a healthy influence on my mind. This beautiful and charming sight of flowers and trees fills my heart with pleasure because they are the fruit of my labour.

My hobby has taught me a great deal about plants. I have first-rate knowledge of many varieties of plants and flowers. This garden has unfolded to me many mysteries of nature. The garden has become the book of nature for me. Gardening gives me a lot of exercises too. It keeps me healthy active and energetic. It saves me from wasting my time in useless activities. It is a great joy for me and makes me happy.

My garden has increased the beauty of my house. All the friends and relatives who visit our house admire the beauty of my garden. They praise my hobby. It is indeed a rewarding experience to see the fruits of labour blooming before your eyes.

As Bacon says

Garden is the purest of human pleasures."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"There are many ways of passing one’s time when one has done one’s duties in the day’s job. Every one has some job or other to do in his life. These jobs are directed to carn money for our maintenance. They are all very serious jobs, requiring effort and concentration of energy, mental or physical, or both. They are certain to tire us. When we have finished our quota of our day’s work, we feel tired. We want rest and entertainment. The things that we do at such times of rest and entertainment are called our hobbies. They are things which help us pass time delightfully. They are, therefore, described as pastimes. They are done in order to give pleasure, not money or fame or any such things. They are labours of love. They are not means to some ends. They are therefore distinguished from jobs and professions which we are dutybound to perform. They are not mean to bring any profit as such. They are done to bring pleasure. They are in the nature of games or plays but they are not mean to be done regularly. Even games are played for exercise for breaking records or winning prizes. But hobbies are endless games. They have no end or aim. The essence of a hobby is its aimlessness. It is a pastime pure and unmixed. It is a favourite pursuit chosen by us. It is not a job imposed by anyone. It is a job of our choice, and freedom of choice is its most distinguishing feature.

There are many hobbies in the world. They are as numerous as there are men and women with varying tastes and preferences. Hobbies are matters of wholly individual tastc. Some of the more common forms of these are gardening, stamp collecting, photography, novel-reading, collecting autographs, long walks, mountaineering, learning of languages, travelling, collecting first editions, rare manuscripts, sporting, fishing, acting, singing, dancing etc, etc. Everyone of these has its own special attractions. Each offers the minimum of pleasure to those who pursue these several favourite pastimes. They are the most absorbing of all pursuits. The pleasure derived from them is pure and unmixed. Some people get disappointed even in the pursuit of hobbies. For example, if a collector of autographs is unable to procure the signature of some great person he is wrong. The essence of a hobby is undiluted pleasure. There may be trouble in collecting different things, but the trouble is more than compensated by the sheer delight of possession."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"What is the importance of cultivating hobbies? Their importance is manifold and manysided. For one thing the pursuit of hobbies gives us rest and relaxation from the drudgery and boredom of our daily occupations. Our jobs and duties of everyday life are none of our own choosing. It is very raer that we get the jobs and duties that we like. They are mostly thrust upon us by circumstances. Do we not see that the works we are called on to do are done not because we like doing them but because hunger and want force us to do the same? We are slaves of circumstances and necessity in the world. We are like bits of wood driven along the currents of circumstances. Such being our life, hobbies free-from the prison of circumstance. We are free to choose what we like. No one forces us to follow a hobby, and if any one does so, it ceases to be a hobby, for, it becomes a job. So freedom, real, lovable freedom is the essence of hobbies. They liberate us from the tyranny of existence and launch us upon the seas of adventure in our own chosen course. We are masters of our own selves as long as we are pursuing our beloved hobbies, though they are only for a short time everyday. But this quality of happiness we get in these brief moments is supremely valuable."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"However the greatest delight and importance of hobbies is psychological. The point here is significant. Hobbies give us the opportunity of using our leisure most creatively. This is their most important function. They are the healthiest type of recreation. They truly recreate us. They give the best direction to our minds and energies when these are not employed in our daily jobs. The problem of leisure is a very thorny one. Of course, most of us do not get leisure at all. But many of us do get leisure, and the problem is how to use spare time at our disposal. Some of us kill time when we have time to spare! This is very strange and very sad. When we are free from daily work we should find a good way of using such free time. Hobbies come in hand for using such time. Time used in hobbies enriches us. It is the true type of self-culture. Our minds are proverbially the Devil’s workshop when they are left idle. They are left after they finish the daily job imposed by hunger. The precious little time of leisure that we get should not be misused. It should be utilised for bettering ourselves culturally and spiritually. To be spiritful is not wholly to be religious orsaintly. It is not given to ordinary men or women to be saints and spiritual mystics. But it is possible for everyone to cultivate the mind and soul and become truly spiritual in a very easy manner. This can be done by pursuing hobbies. For hobbies not only give delight, they give knowledge and enlightment. Real enlightment comes when the things we do are done with love and pleasure. From this point of view, hobbies become the agencies by which we become cultured in the simplest and truest sense of the word. There is really no limit to the progress we can make in the way. We become truly happy in a world which is for most of us a very unhappy place. This is so because we are not free to choose the jobs we like to do. This is why hobbies become So supremely important."
,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"Considered from any point of view, hobbies are the gateway through which we pass from the world of work and care to a world of work and pleasure. All pleasurable work is really no work at all. It is a kind of play. It is the right type of work in which we exercise our body and mind most fruitfully. In an ideal society, everyone might get the job he loves to do. In such a perfect society there is still place for hobbies. This is so because even the work we love might become exhausting after some time. The nature of our body and mind is such that we are tired after certain time in any kind of work. It is at such time that we begin to see the value of hobbies. Hobbies really are change of work. They are work for they require both bodily and mental effort. But the differnce is that such work is not continued beyond a certain limit. When we have done day’s job, of which we are really satisfied. And when we have spent our time in our hobbies we are in position to bring our appointed jobs. Thus changes of work give us the needed recreation which sends us refreshed for work. Hobbies serve this most important purpose.

Let us by all means, choose our hobbies and pursue them in the precious moments of leisure we get. Hobbies thus pursued are most enjoyable. They widen our outlook of life. They increase our appetite for experience. They drive away depression. They fill vacant minds with pleasant ideas. They train our motions and passions. They a make us seekers of beauty, for there is nothing more beautiful than our pet hobbies. No matter how poor our worldly existence, we can become happy in the pursuit of favourite pastime. This is to become spiritually rich.

Finally a word of caustion seems to be called for. And here it is. Let us not permit our hobbies to become expensive beyond our means. We must ride our hobby horses but we must not ride, them beyond certain limit. We must not allow our hobbies to interfere with our daily duties. Hobbies are our modes of escape from the drudgery of occupations. But daily occupations must be gone through no matter, how difficult or tiresome. Life is not a bed of thornless roses. Let us not complain about thorns. Let us be thankful that there are roses even if there are thorns. So let us face life and do our duties, however thorny they might be. Let us come back from daily duties to our dead hobbies. Let us use our hobbies to recreate our exhausted energies in such a way that we go to our daily jobs and duties with renewed vigour. Let our hobbies be the sweet dreams which brighten our dull and dreary monotony of daily life. So only shall we have wisely used our hobbies. They are tonic stuff and should not become drugs."

The best form of recreation is one that can develop in person awareness, concentration and an observational power. In pursuance of a hobby, one can enjoy one’s leisure and learn at the same time.

There are many activities in our life which can be developed into hobbies or interests. One should choose a hobby wisely. Reading, gardening, indoor games, painting, writing, singing, dancing, or even decorating a house etc. are some well-known hobbies. President APJ Abdul Kalam listens to sitar recitals when he has leisure-time.
Hobbies fill a gap. They can lift our spirits when we are depressed. They make us creative. Many friendships are forged among people who have common hobbies. The unique quality of a person can be developed with the help of a good hobby.

It eases our mind to be absorbed in something. We have something to show to our friends and it is something which is educating and brings relaxation to a tired mind. Many hobbies can be used commercially and can bring fame. Hobby is constructive. It gives the mind something positive to hold on to. Nothing can make you feel bored while you have an interesting hobby to turn to."

leisure activities",,,,,,,,,"Games and sports are a necessary part of our life. They are to the body what education is to the mind. But, no. they are an integral part of education itself.

Those who have not played any games in life should consider their education incomplete. Gandhi greatly lamented for not having given proper attention to games during his formative years.

Games provide the best physical exer­cise to a child. They improve our digestive system and make us strong and smart. In the modern world which is full of struggle, it is very necessary to have a strong body. One, who is physically weak, is prone to many diseases.

Games make our body elastic. They provide us relaxation and entertainment. They instill into our minds the spirit of healthy competition, discipline, so” Truman- ship and team-spirit. They teach us to play for the sake of play and not to feel depressed in the event of defeat.

After a day’s hard work at school or college, a student can get rid of boredom on the play-ground. Work alone is not enough. That is why it is said: “All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy”. Moreover, games make our minds fresh and strong. It is said: “A sound mind lives only in a sound body” One can concentrate much better on books after having had played for some time. A book-worm, who pores over his books day and night, gets his mental faculties blunted. He may show a bit better results in the examination, but at best he just ends up as a crammer, devoid of all sense of novelty and originality.

It must, however, be admitted that remaining busy in games all the time at the cost of studies is by no means something wise. The wisest thing is to keep a healthy balance between the games and the studies. They should be complementary to each other. In any case, games are indispensable for all round development of one’s personality."

Ans: Village people also enjoy our native games for example Kabaddi, football, hadudu, cricket etc. Besides, very often they raise a storm on the cup of tea in the tea stall about the political condition of the country. Thus, it is found that pastimes of the urban people are different from those rural people.

,,,,,hobbies and pasttimes,,,,,,,,,"Hobby is a useful work which is done in spare time for pleasure without any monetary benefit. This occupation is quite apart from the regular profession. It is pursued only for recreation. After hard labour, hobby provides us a cheap source of entertainment and amusement. It saves us from the dull routine of life. It gives us an activity when we have nothing to do.

There are many hobbies like gardening, stamp-collecting, coin-collecting, photography, reading, etc. Everyone chooses his hobby according to this taste and requirement. Gardening is my favourite hobby. I want to relax after a day’s hard labour. Gardening makes me forget my worries and refreshes my mind.

From the garden of plants;
Do I move towards the garden of inner joys;
The flowers dance on leaves,
And ideas dance on heartbeats and mind.

I have a beautiful lawn in my house. Whenever I can spare time, I take interest in cultivating beautiful flowers in it. I have grown flowers plants of rose, lily and sunflower. The sweet fragrance of the flowers gives me great pleasure. There is always something fresh before my eyes. It keeps me healthy, happy and fresh for the day’s labour. It is a source of physical exercise and aesthetic pleasure.

“A thing of beauty is a joy forever.” (Keats)

I have the tools of the gardener. I have to do a lot of work with my own hands. I prepare the land and manure it. I water my plants regularly and protect them for the extreme weather. I have prepared many beds in it. Each bed contains flowers of different shapes and colours. I have also grown vegetables for our daily use. So, we do not purchase vegetables from the market.

“Earth is here so kind, that just tickles her with a hoe and she laughs with a harvest.”

Gardening is my passion. It inspires me to do something new. Whenever I cast a glance over my small beautiful lawn, my heart blossoms. With every new flower, there is new happiness. I keenly observe the process of grown and decay in nature and praise the Majesty of Allah. My hobby, gardening, keeps me in touch with nature and God.

And in my flower-beds, I think,
Smile the carnation and the pink; (Rupert Brooke)"

Furthermore, it also gives them time to relax with their families. Other cousins also visit each other’s places and spend time there. They play games and go out with each other. Moreover, students also get plenty of time to complete their homework and revise the syllabus."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Holidays for working people are somewhat similar to what they mean for students. In fact, they carry more importance to them than students. Though they are adults, they also yearn for the holidays. Why so? They do not get as many holidays as students do.

Most importantly, the holiday no matter how little it gives them a great chance to relax. More so because they work tirelessly for so many hours a day without a break. Some even work when they get home. This makes their schedule very hectic and gives them little time to rest. A holiday fills the gap for this rest.

Importance of Holidays for Students

We all know that students have to cope with a lot of competition these days. They barely get any time to play and have a lot of homework and assignments to complete every day. Routine tests and exams don’t leave enough time for other extracurricular activities.

It is true that studies are important; nevertheless, play and social interaction is as much important for the students. Sadly, students don’t get to spend enough time with their family and friends, forget the play. A holiday is a time when students can relax and spend time with their family. They can also go on a picnic, watch a movie or do whatever they want. If anyone doesn’t want to move out, they can at least stay home with their parents and siblings and discuss about their studies and other issues.

It is also time to round up your friends and play with them for longer hours than usual. During a holiday you get to play more than other days as you don’t have to go to school or do homework.

Importance of Holidays for Working Professionals

Working professionals also love holidays as much as the students do. Life at the office is stressful and demands a dedicated work for at least eight to nine hours or sometimes even more than that. This is common with most of the offices. After office hours, people get so much tired that they barely manage to take dinner and go to sleep. Worse, the same cycle of events continues for weeks over weeks with just one exception – Sunday.

It’s not hard to guess how much important a Sunday or any other holiday, for that matter, is for someone who has to follow strict office routine and meet deadlines, six days a week. Sunday is the most awaited day of the week by every office goer. They get the time to spend with their family, with their children, go on a picnic with them or just take them to a local market. There are hundreds of things that professionals dream of doing in one single day. Like a Sunday any other holiday is also most welcomed and awaited."

,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"School days are said to be the best part of a person’s life. Though there is a lot of study pressure on the students, it offers a number of other aspects to cherish throughout lives. Among other things, the summer, winter and autumn breaks that students get during their academic session are the best part of their journey. Students are lucky to get several holidays during the year. They get ample time to relax, indulge in their hobbies and go on holiday trips.

With the five days week culture creeping in the corporate sector these days working people are also able to plan holiday trips every now and then. Saturday and Sunday coupled with one holiday makes for a good weekend outing. Working professionals these days are required to work for 9-10 hours a day. Such hectic working hours often result in stress and can lead to health issues. Holidays offer a respite from this hectic routine. It is a time to relax and rejuvenate. It is also a time to bond with family and friends.

Holidays indeed hold a special importance for every person. Besides indulging in different activities you must also take out enough time to take rest and relax during your holidays."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Introduction

A student’s life revolves around homework, exam preparation and tests. So basically studies, studies and more studies. We go to school then go to the coaching centre and then study at home. There is hardly any time for other activities especially in the higher classes. Sundays come as a respite but mostly there is some or the other test scheduled for Monday so we cannot escape studies even for a single day in a week.

My Fond Memories of My Summer Holidays

Summer holidays are the best time of the year for every student. We plan a family trip during our summer vacations every year. Our family trip is the best part of these holidays and I always look forward to it. Most of the times the four of us that is my father, mother, brother and I go on these trips but many times my cousins also join us. These trips are always full of fun. Last year, we went to Ooty and Mysore for six days. Both the places were spectacular. Ooty was particularly awesome. These places encompass many beautiful gardens and marvellous edifices. We went for sight-seeing, had scrumptious food and spent quality time with each other. It was a great experience. It was one of the best family trips we had every gone for. It was also the longest one. We often plan holidays only for 2-3 days but this one was for 6 days and was thus more fun. I cherish the days spent there. These are my fondest memories of my summer holidays.

Conclusion

Holidays are a good time to take a break from the routine. It is the time to indulge in our hobbies, meet our old friends and extended family members. However, we must not let our studies take a back seat during this time. We must devote some time to studies even during our holidays."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Introduction

Holidays are a time to be with the family and friends. It is also the time to indulge in our favourite sport or pursue our hobbies. We make numerous plans for our holidays but most of them are not fulfilled. One of the main reasons for this is procrastination. We want to do a lot during our holidays but usually get lazy and vile away the time only to regret at the end of the holidays.

Ways to Make the Most of Your Holidays?

Here are a few ways to make the most of your holidays to get back to work with fresh mind.

Don’t Leave Your Work
Holiday is not a time to take a break from your studies or work in fact it is the time to improvise on these things. If you leave your work or study during your holidays (especially during long vacations) you will find it very difficult to get back with it as you resume your office/ school. This will create dissatisfaction and you will yearn for another holiday to set things right. So why not keep things managed during your break and get back to work with confidence and enthusiasm.

Now, don’t over indulge in your work. Just squeeze in an hour or two each day for the same so that you stay in touch.

Follow Your Hobby/ Interest
It is a good idea to join a hobby class. Indulge in anything of your choice such as dancing, swimming, yoga, painting, sketching or music. Take-up a short course for a week or 10 days depending on the number of holidays you have.

Meet Friends and Relatives
Socialising is very important. We don’t get enough time to visit our friends and relatives due to our hectic routine. But we can certainly do so during our holidays. So take out time to meet them.

Go on a Trip
Go for a trip with your family or friends to take a break from your routine life. Trips are refreshing. I always make it a point to go for one trip each during my summer and winter holidays.

Spend Time with Your Family
Most importantly, spend time with your family. Family always comes first! So, you must spend quality time with each of your family members. Spend time with your grandparents, parents and siblings to strengthen your bond.


Conclusion

Holidays are a great time to bond with family and friends. It is also a time to follow your interests and rejuvenate yourself. So, make the most of this time."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Introduction

Holidays hold immense importance in a person’s life. Be it a student, a working professional or a businessman – everyone wants a break from their work. Holidays provide this much awaited break. They are also important for many other reasons.

Importance of Holidays for Students

Holidays are a time when we can finally take a break from our otherwise hectic routine and follow our hobbies and interests. I always make it a point to join a hobby course during holidays. I love art and craft and thus join different art and craft classes to hone my skills in the same. Last year, I joined glass painting classes, prior to that I joined pottery classes and this year I am planning to learn the art of candle making. My friends also join different classes as per their interest. Some of them join dance classes, others join vocal/ instrumental music while yet others join sports such as skating, swimming and basket ball.

Holidays are also a time when we can socialise with friends and relatives and spend time with our family. I love family outings. We plan at least one family trip during summer vacations. I am also allowed to go over to my friends place to spend the day every once in a while. I also love the time when my cousins come over to stay at my place. Those days are particularly the best part of the summer vacations.

Most importantly, holidays are a time when we can relax and understand how to improve our skills to perform better in our exams as well as other activities. I make sure that I set aside at least 2-3 hours a day to study during the vacations. This helps me keep pace with my studies as I join back.

Importance of Holidays for Working People

Working professionals and businessmen also yearn for holidays. But they do not get long vacations like the school and college going kids. However, whatever little break they get they must make the most of it by indulging in the activity of their choice.

Working professionals mostly have long working hours these days. Many people even require working after they get back home from their work place. This hectic professional life often takes a toll on their personal life. They are hardly able to spend any time with their family members and this result in conflicts and strained relationships. Holidays give them an opportunity to spend time with their family to strengthen the bond. It is a good idea to plan a family vacation. Socialising is also very important and this can also be done during holidays as the hectic work routine does not allow any room for it during the regular days. It is a good time to meet one’s friends and relatives. Holidays are also a time to relax and focus on one’s physical as well as mental health.

Conclusion

Holidays are important as they help in maintaining a balance between our personal and professional life. We must spend them wisely to make the most of them."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Holidays are the best time of the year. I always look forward to my summer holidays as these are the longest holidays we students get during the year. I mostly spend them with my family and extended family. My parents also allow me to go on a few outings with friends as a reward if I study and behave well during the holidays.

My First Holiday with School Friends

Until 5th grade my parents did not allow me to go for school trips but as I entered my 6th grade I got this chance. My school had organized a three day trip to Shimla during the summer vacations. Many of my friends filled the consent to go for the trip. I wanted to go to but feared that my parents would not agree. At first, I thought there was no point even asking because their answer would only be no but my friends insisted I should.

I still remember how I hesitantly handed over the consent form for the trip to my father and began telling him about the details of the trip. I also told him that many of my classmates are going for it and that I also wanted to go. Initially, he refused as he felt I was too young to go out without their supervision. It took me around 2 days to convince my mother to allow me to go for the trip and she in turn convinced my father for the same. I was finally glad and super excited about the trip. I promised them that I will not talk to strangers, always move with the group and be careful with everything during the trip.

We travelled from Delhi to Kalka in train and then took a bus to reach Shimla. We reached our hotel in the afternoon. The first day we went to the mall road. The weather was pleasant and the place was amazing. I had been to various hill stations earlier as well but this place had something very refreshing about it. The company of friends made it all the more amazing. We roam around on the mall road and had planned to have dinner in a restaurant on our way back to the hotel but could not resist the smell of freshly steamed momos. They were super delicious and we ate so many of them that there was no room for dinner.

The next day we went to the Jakhu temple. The road to the temple was quite steep and we encountered hundreds of langoors on our way. It was a bit scary but exciting at the same time. The temple is set at a very serene place and we loved sitting in peace for some time. On our way back we decided to trek down the road and the experience was amazing. In the evening we visited the church and spent time on the mall road again. On the third day of our trip our teachers allowed us to go for shopping. We went to the Tibetan market to buy some really cool stuff. I bought scarves, hair clips and a jacket for myself. I also bought souvenirs for my siblings and friends.

The time finally came when we had to bid goodbye to the beautiful mountains and valley view of Shimla. We took the night bus straight for Delhi and reached home safely.

Conclusion

I had been on many family trips before this and loved them but the joy and excitement of going on trips with friends is something different. Since then I have been on many t"
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Just as sleep is necessary for our body similarly holidays are important for relaxation and change – they provide relief from the monotony of our daily routine. They are important for our mental and emotional well being.

Holidays! Holidays! Holidays who does not wait for them? Holidays give us a break from our routine and help us to refresh ourselves and go back to work with renewed energy.

They are not only meant for enjoying but also for pursuing our hobbies and interests. During holidays we can live our life as we want. There are no rules for getting up in the morning and going to school, coming back home, having lunch, playing for a short while and then completing the home work.

We are our own rulers as we manage our time according lo our own wish; we play, visit places, pursue our hobbies and are relaxed.

After working hard throughout the year, summer holidays are eagerly awaited by students and teachers alike. During summer break my family always goes to a hill station for nearly 20 to 25 days. We have a small cottage there and we enjoy ourselves, away from the hustle and bustle of the city life, in the lap of Mother Nature.

We play indoor games like cards, carom board, loud and chess. We also go for walks in the evenings, the cool fresh air, the long walks late into the night, having boiled eggs and corn from the road side is truly enjoyable. When we come back to our cottage we are tired but very happy and have a good night’s sleep.

After a good night’s sleep the chirping of the birds and the golden sunlight wakes us up gently. A hot cup of tea in the morning is truly welcome especially in the pleasant weather of a hill station.

I read many story books during my summer holidays and enjoy every moment of it. I enjoy my summer holidays also because I get time to spend with my parents. We go together for picnics and watch lot movies. I have a nice time during my holidays but I also keep some time aside for my friends. I chat with them and also play games with them but of course, on line. We get holidays during winter as well as autumn. Autumn break is the time when my family and I enjoy the festive season. We do not go out during autumn break as we are busy celebrating different festivals. During the winter break, my father usually takes us to visit some or the other place but our visit is a short visit, of a week or so, only.

I know, holidays are enjoyed more by those, who work hard, because they bring a change for them rather then for those who while away their time. It is indeed true that life without holidays would become boring, making one lose all interest in work and studies after all “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy”. Thus, holidays are as important for as going to school and study."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"I anxiously waited for the Punjab holidays. My father, and already got the rail and hotel reservations. He wanted o take us on a joy trip to Darjeeling, the Himalayan Jewel and the Queen of the Hill Stations. I was really excited and so was my younger sister nailing. At last our schools closed for Dessert and Puja Holidays. It gave us much relief and no less joy.

Mother had made all the preparations, we helped her in it. I had obtained some literature, maps and illustrations about Darjeeling and had gone through them. They fired my imagination and expectations. I shared these with my mother and sister and they appreciated it a lot. At last we set out on our journey to Darjeeling on a fine morning.

It was a long but pleasant journey from Delhi to Jalpaiguri. From there Darjeeling is about 82 kames. From there to Darjeeling was really an exciting arid unforgettable experience for all of us in the famous toy train. I had heard and read much about it. I also saw it in a couple of films, but now I had its first hand experience. The train passed through lush green and thick terrain forest. There were fascinating scenes of hills, waterfalls and woolly clouds almost touching the ground. The tall trees like oak, pine and fir added to the majesty and beauty do the sight. The huge terraced tea plantations all along the railway track also presented a beautiful picture to the eyes. It all looked like a journey into a fairy-land. It took us about six hours but time flew fast and it looked like a short dream in the morning, lasting a few seconds. The train passed by tiny villages and through hamlets chugging its way up the mountains. It went up slowly but majestically. Many young men and children were seen boarding and getting down from the running train with perfect ease and safety. The simple mountain folks waved us good bye all along the railway journey. They looked happy, contented and innocent. Their faces were lighted up with smile and simplicity. They wove simple but colorful garments. It was a real fun, joy and happiness to pass through the wooded mountains in the mini train. This journey itself sufficiently rewarded our expectations and hopes.

We stayed in a comfortable hotel with all the modern amenities. We enjoyed our stay there to the full, visiting places and vantage points of the famous hill and health resort. The township ran both vertically and horizontally. There were many giant landing places joined with one another with many flights of steps. The town offered fascinating view of majestic snow-capped mountain peaks. But the most fascinating was that of the Kanchenjunga peak. The chow Rasta at the top of the ridge forms the centre of the town. It is also the shopping centre. The bazaars and streets of the lower town were also busy places. They were full of hustle and bustle.

Next day, very early in the morning, we visited the famous Tiger Mill. It is eleven kilometers from the town. A big crowd of tourists had collected there to have the enchanting view of the Kanchenjunga and other Himalayan peaks. We were lucky as it was a clear and cloudless dawn. It offered us a clear view of the towering, snow-capped and majestic peaks. The Kanchenjunga emerged out of the obscurity of the early dawn so wonderfully. Then it displayed many colours and hues as the sun-rays touched this icy peak. First it looked orange, then fiery red and then finally dazzling silver with the coming up of the sun. Many people from the crowd shouted with joy. Others clapped in admiration. But some others drank its beauty in silence. On the way back to our hotel we visited the Gloom Monastery, a famous Buddhist temple. There, the 15 feet giant image of Buddha looked awesome and yet inspired pure religious sentiments. We also enjoyed our visits to Himalayan Mountaineering Institute and to Lloyd Botanical Gardens. Zoological Park is another popular attraction of Darjeeling. We also visited the Happy Valley Tea Estate. The men and women-folk were busy in vast tea plantations. We also learnt there how tea leaves are processed for our final consumption.

Our joy-ride in the long passenger ropeway was no less exciting and enjoyable. In the beginning, I was afraid lest something dangerous should happen. But gradually I overcame my fears and enjoyed it the most. It presented a panoramic view of the hills, rivers and plantations from so high above the ground.

We planned to visit Kali pong. A beautiful town about 51 kames away from Darjeeling. It is a market town with majestic Himalayas in the background and gently rolling hills around. But suddenly, there was an emergency phone-call from my father’s office in Delhi. He was urged to return immediately because of some urgent business. Father took the next available flight to Delhi and we could not visit the big and colorful town of Kali pong. We returned to Delhi by train, full of colorful and unforgettable memories and experience. We had exposed a number of films to capture the wonderful scenes, sights and breath­taking views of nature. Mow they form a valuable part of our family albums. I wonder if I would ever again have such wonderful Puja Holidays. It was really a fantastic experience to see the formidable Himalayas clothed in its full majesty and grandeur at Darjeeling. It is a place comparable with paradise. I feel very proud to think how vast, beautiful, rich and wonderful my country is."

Instead of staying in a hotel, I stayed with one of my old friends. It was so much fun, and a little bit like my old life. I wanted to do all the same things I did in my university days, so I visited the university. It has changed a lot and looks more modern. I also went to the supermarket near my old house. I loved seeing all the different foods. I was really happy to find my favourite cheese and chocolate biscuits but they were a bit more expensive than I remember!

We did some touristy things too. We walked up beautiful Petrin Hill and around the castle. The views of the city are amazing up there. We walked across the historic Charles Bridge. My friend's flat is very near the TV Tower so we saw the famous baby statues climbing up it. Those things haven't changed, of course."

I usually spend them with my family and extended family. As a reward for studying and behaving well during the holidays, my parents also allow me to go on a few outings with friends. Essay on Holiday
My First Holiday with School Friends
After I entered my 6th grade, my parents allowed me to go on school trips for the first time. In the summer break, I went on a 3-day trip to Shimla with my school. My friends all filled out vacation consent forms, but I was afraid that my parents would not agree to let me go.  My friends insisted that I ask even though their answer could only be no.
As I recall, I reluctantly handed my father the consent form for the trip and started explaining the details of the trip to him. Then, he questioned whether I was old enough to go out without his supervision, even though many of my classmates were doing it.
I had to convince my mother for two days before she would let me take the trip, and she then persuaded my father to permit it. Finally, I was glad about the trip. I promised the group that I would not talk to strangers, always travel with the group, and take care of everything during the trip.
After travelling by train and bus to Kalka, we took a taxi to Shimla, and then checked in to our hotel. We visited the mall road on the first day. The weather was perfect and the place was stunning. While I had previously been to hillsides, this one had a very refreshing feeling to it. The company of friends made it even more memorable. On our way back to the hotel we decided to stop at a restaurant on the mall road instead of eating momos as we walked down the street. It was such a treat to eat all of them that dinner was unaffordable.
We visited the Jakhu temple the next day. The road was steep, and we encountered hundreds of langoors on the way. We enjoyed the temple’s serene setting and enjoyed sitting in peace for some time. It was a little scary, but exciting at the same time. Later in the evening we visited a church and walked through the mall road again. On the way back, we decided to trek down the road, which was an awesome experience. We went to the Tibetan market on the third day of our trip to buy some cool stuff. Our teachers let us go shopping. I purchased scarves, hair clips and a jacket for myself, as well as souvenirs for my siblings and friends.
After our time in Shimla was up, we boarded the overnight bus straight to Delhi, reaching home safely.
Conclusion

 

 
Prior to this trip, I had been on many family trips and loved them, but the excitement and joy of going on a trip with friends is something different. My friends and I have taken many trips together since then, but I will always be inspired by my first trip with them."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"There are a lot of holidays in the USA. Many of them are associated with the history of the nation. The main holidays of the USA are New Year's Day, Easter, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas.
The New Year's Eve is a time for merriment. Most Americans spend this night with friends, at home or in restaurants. Thousands of people gather in New York in Times Square to see the New Year in. The Tournament of Roses takes place in Pasadena, California, on January 1 each year. Prizes are given to the cities with the most unusual floral compositions.

Thanksgiving Day comes on the fourth Thursday of November. When the first settlers landed in America, their first year was very hard and 50 of 100 people died. But the Indians taught people how to plant corn and wild vegetables and in autumn they got a large harvest. Thanksgiving Day was their holiday, the day of giving thanks to God. It is a family holiday and Americans try to gather all family at home on this day.
There are also some holidays which are not celebrated nation-wide, but only by each state separately."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"American holidays are strikingly different in origin and show surprising similarities in the manner of their celebration. No matter what the holiday's origin is, they all seem to be the same thing. A holiday has simply become, for most Americans, a day off from work, though some (for example, Thanksgiving and Christmas) retain some individuality.
The major holidays in the USA are:
New Year's Day, January, 1st:
People stay awake until after midnight on December 31st to ""watch the Old Year out and the New Year in."" Many parties are given on this night. Theatres, night clubs, restaurants are crowded. When midnight comes, they greet the New Year: people gather in the streets of big cities, they ring bells, blow whistles and automobile horns, some shoot off guns and firecrackers.
Valentine's Day, February, 14th:
It is not a national holiday. Banks and offices do not close, but it is a happy little festival in honour of St Valentine, patron of sweethearts and lovers. It is widely celebrated among people of all ages by the exchange of ""valentines."" A ""valentine"" may mean a special greeting card or a little present. The greeting cards are often coloured red, have red trimmings and pictures of hearts.
Washington's Birthday, February, 22d:
In addition to commemorating the birth of the United States' first President, it's a great day for shoppers. The department stores of Washington, DC, stated a national tradition of sales marked by unusual bargains. It is not a national holiday. Many schools, offices and banks close for this day, some stay open. The US Congress observes the birthday of George Washington with speeches and readings from his works.
Easter:
Easter is in memory of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. It falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon between March, 22, and April, 25. The 40 days before Easter are called Lent. Just before Easter, schools and colleges usually close. Students have a week or ten days of spring vacation. Easter is a church holiday, and many churches have an outdoor sunrise service. People give each other presents of eggs which are the symbol of new life. There is a popular belief that wearing three new things on Easter will bring good luck throughout the year.

Halloween, October, 31st:
Halloween is the day or evening before All Saints' Day. Halloween customs date back to a time when people believed in devils, witches and ghosts. They thought that these evil spirits could do all kinds of damage to property. Some people tried to ward off witches by painting magic signs on their barns. Others tried to scare them away by nailing a piece of iron, such as a horseshoe, over the door. Now most people do not believe in evil spirits. On this day they just have a nice holiday. Children dress up as ghosts and witches and go out into the streets to beg. They go from house to house and say: ""Trick of treat!"", meaning ""Give me a treat or I'll play a trick on you"". People give them candy, cookies and apples. A favourite custom is to make a jack-o'-lantem. Children scrape out a pumpkin and cut the outlines of eyes, nose and mouth in its side. They light a candle inside the pumpkin to scare their friends. This custom refers to a man named Jack who still wanders around the earth lighting his way with a pumpkin lantern.
Veterans Day:
On this day, the radio and television broadcast services held at the National Cemetery in Arlington. High officials come from Washington to attend these services.

,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"There is a number of holidays in the USA which are celebrated every year. Here are some of them.

The 1st of January is New Year's Day. People do not go to bed until after midnight on December 31. They like to see ""the old year out and the new year in"". Many people give parties on New Year's Eve.

Memorial Day, or Decoration Day, is dedicated to those who fought in the War of Independence, in World War I or in World War II.

The 4th of July is Independence Day. It is the biggest national holiday in the USA. The Declaration of Independence was proclaimed in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, when the American colonies were fighting for independence against England.

On the 11th of November there is Veteran's Day. It is I dedicated to those who fell in the two World Wars.

Thanksgiving Day is on the fourth Thursday in November. In the autumn of 1621, the Pilgrim Fathers celebrated their first harvest festival in America and called it Thanksgiving Day. Since that time it has been celebrated every year.

Christmas is celebrated on the 25th of December. People usually stay at home in Christmas time, and spend the day with their families."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Memorial Day is a legal holiday, observed annually on the last Monday in May in most of the United States, It honours the nation's armed services killed in wartime. The holiday, originally called Decoration Day, is traditionally marked by parades, memorial speeches and ceremonies, and the decoration of graves with flowers and flags. Memorial Day was first observed on May 30, 1868, on the order of General John Alexander Logan for the purpose of decorating the graves of the American Civil War dead. It was observed on May 30 until 1971, when most states changed to a newly established federal schedule of holiday observance.

Independence Day is an annual holiday commemorating the formal adoption by the Continental Congress of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia. Although the signing of the Declaration was not completed until August, the Fourth of July holiday has been accepted as the official anniversary of United States independence and is celebrated in all states and territories of the U.S.

The Fourth of July is traditionally celebrated publicly with parades and pageants, patriotic speeches, and organised firing of guns and cannons and displays of fireworks. Family picnics and outings are a feature of private Fourth of July celebrations.

Thanksgiving Day, a legal holiday in the U.S., was first celebrated in early colonial times in New England. The actual origin is probably the harvest festivals that are traditional in many parts of the world. After the first harvest was completed by the Plymouth colonists in 1621, Governor William Bradford proclaimed a day of thanksgiving.

In 1863 President Abraham Lincoln appointed a day of thanksgiving, and since then each president has issued a Thanksgiving Day proclamation, generally designating the fourth Thursday of November as a holiday.

New Year's Day is the first day of the year, January 1 in the Gregorian calendar. In the Middle Ages most European countries used the Julian calendar and observed New Year's Day on March 25, called Annunciation Day and celebrated as the birth to the Son of God. With the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582, Roman Catholic countries began to celebrate New Year's Day on January 1.

The custom of visiting friends, relatives and neighbours on New Year's Day is one of the Old World traditions that has taken on a new form in the United States. A favourite place to see the old year out is New York City's Time Square.

Christmas is an annual festival, held on December 25, to celebrate the Nativity, or birth of Christ. The Christmas tree, an evergreen trimmed with lights and other decorations, is derived from the so-called paradise tree, symbolising Eden.

Saint Valentine's Day, a holiday honouring lovers, is celebrated on February 14. There is a custom of sending greeting cards or gifts to express affection. The cards, known as valentines, are often designed with hearts to symbolise love. The holiday probably derives from the ancient Roman feast of Lupercalis (February 15). The festival gradually became associated with the feast day (February 14) of two Roman martyrs, both named St. Valentine, who lived in the 3rd century. St. Valentine has traditionally been regarded as the patron saint of lovers."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"The word ""Christmas"" is derived from the words ""Christ's Mass"" - the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. But although Christmas is undoubtedly a Christian celebration, it is also true to say that it is an unusual combination of pagan and Christian festivities.

A Christmas tree stands in everybody's living room at Christmas, shining its good cheer around the room. Sitting on the very top of the tree is a silver star surrounded by tiny lights. All the branches are hung with silver bells, tinsel and sparkling lights. Around the base of the tree lie the gifts and toys wrapped up in bright colourful paper.

The Christmas tree has spread its influence around the world. In fact America adopted it before it found its way to England early in Queen Victoria's reign. Now every Christmas British people are sent a huge fir tree from Norway which stands in Trafalgar Square, in the centre of London, shining down on all the people who gather on Christmas Eve.

In pre-Christian times evergreens, trees that remain green throughout the year. were worshiped in Northern Europe as symbols of eternal life. Mistletoe, hung up as a Christmas decoration is a symbol of love and reconciliation.

Holly, a well-known Christmas decoration today, has Christian associations. In Norwegian, Swedish and Danish, holly is known as ""Christ's thorns"", the legend being that Christ wore a crown of holly thorns before his death. Some people have seen associations between the word ""holly"" and ""holy"".

Giving presents goes back to Roman Saturnalia when good luck gifts of fruit, pastry or gold were given to friends on New Year's Day. In Britain the traditional day to give presents until relatively recently was December 26th and not as it is today, Christmas Day. December 26th is now known as Boxing Day, for it was then that the priests of the Middle Ages opened alms boxes to give to the poor.

Not all Christian customs and traditions are of ancient origin. Although various people have claimed to have designed the first Christmas card. William Egley, an English artist, seems to have the best claim. In 1842 he designed his own card and sent it to one hundred of his friends. Today three billion are sent annually in the United States alone."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Mother's Day comes on the second Sunday in May. It is a day when Americans honour their mothers. It is not a national holiday. Mother's Day is an American national observance in honour of motherhood. The holiday, suggested by Anna Jarvis of Philadelphia, was set (1914) by an act of Congress for annual celebration. It is also observed in England and Germany. In 1907, the day was celebrated in a church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A member of that church planned the Sunday morning service to honour her own mother. More and more churches in cities and states set aside the day to honour mothers. Since 1914, the whole country has observed Mother's day. Most mothers like to celebrate the day with family reunions. Many people send their mothers a card or a gift. Some people take their mothers to a restaurant for dinner. It is a custom to wear a red or pink flower if one's mother is living. It is the custom to wear a white flower if one's mother is dead."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"April Fool's Day or all Fool's Day is the first of April. The fun of the holiday is to play silly but harmless jokes on family members and friends. The victim of these jokes is called an April fool. This holiday first appeared in France when the French began to use the Gregorian calendar, some people continued to use the old calendar and to celebrate New Year's Day in April 1. These people were called April fools. Playing jokes on this day became popular first in France and then in many other countries. Today, April Fool's jokes are played mostly by children, who enjoy the holiday very much."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Every nation has its own customs and long-lived traditions. There is a great number of exciting events which are held in every country throughout the year. Such events of national importance unite people, make them feel proud of their nation.
Each family is like a little country with its own traditions. So and my family. We celebrate all holidays in a very special way and it keeps our family together in spirit. Our most favorite holiday is Christmas. We celebrate it on the 25th of December. Preparation for Christmas are always pleasant: buying gifts, sending Christmas cards and decorating Christmas tree with small, bright-colored lights and small colored glass ornaments. Our church holds a special service on Sunday before Christmas. We sing songs, give presents and then there is always a staging about Christmas. And the best thing about this staging is that all actors are only children, whose touching playing makes this day more wonderful. And then the Christmas comes. It starts in the morning with the smell of cookies, cakes, chocolate and cinnamon. My mom makes the most tasty cakes and cookies in the world and I enjoy decorating them with the specially-prepared cream. The receipt of this cream is kept in a secret among the women of our family. It is told from mother to daughter only. The cookies and cakes are very special not only because of the cream but also because of their form and color. For example, they look like Christmas-trees, funny smiling faces, or teddy-bears. When the meal is ready the real Christmas comes with the big family dinner, gifts, candles, sweets and illumination. In our family this dinner is very important, all the members should be present. I believe that on this day if you make a wish staying next to the Christmas tree it will undoubtedly come true, just because it is Christmas. Usually we celebrate this holiday in a family circle but sometimes we invite our relatives and close friends to the party. Next morning after Christmas we all are looking for the sweets which the Father Frost puts into the Christmas stoking. I don't really believe in Father Frost but I believe that Christmas is a very unusual holiday when the wonders happen and all dreams may come true."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Another holiday that is especially popular in my family is St. Valentine's day. February 14 is the day of lovers. Boys and girls, sweethearts and lovers, husbands and wives, friends and neighbours, and even the office staff exchange greetings of affection. Valentine's day is a whirl of hearts, candy and good wishes in the form of bright, lacy, colorful cards, with loving emblems and amorous doggerel, saying: ""Be my Valentine"". People give and get presents decorated with love emblems: hearts, roses, ribbons and lace. I like both giving and receiving presents. There is a wonderful feeling when you open the rustling colorful paper or watch the face-expression of the person who is trying to guess what you put inside of this box for him.
My family strongly believe in rules and traditions. All my life is filled with traditions which have been set by my grand-grand parents long ago. We have traditions in fashion, in food, in behavior and in all other aspects of life. I would like to tell about fashion traditions, passed down in my family from mother to daughter with the unquestioned authority of the Ten Commandments. You never wear clothes with food on them, clothes should not have holes in them, clothes should not be dirty. My sister and me sometimes call these rules: Mother being annoying. In our family you are not allowed to wear short skirts or too tight trousers. My dad often explains his decision in this area of fashion with the short phrase: Let's not advertise what we don't have for sale. Time to time I fight against these rules and develop my own set of personal fashion rules. But as they say, every journey is a return journey. My hair is often pulled back in a bun. To dress up, I have a long, embroidered skirt that I wear with black lace-up boots and a turtleneck. I think my grand-grand-grand mother would be pleased. Fashion, after all, is rules - what changes is who makes the rules."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"There are many customs and traditions in England. And I wouldlike to tell you some of them. First tradition is called ""Wrongside of the bed"". When people are bad tempered we say that theymust have got out of bed on the wrong side. Originally, it wasmeant quite literally. People belive that the way they rose inthe morning affected their behaivor throughout the day. The wrongside of the bed was the left side. The left always waslinked with evil. The second custom is called ""Blowing out thecandles"". The custom of having candles on birthday cakes goes backto the ancient Greeks. Worshippers of Artemis, goddess of the moonand hunting, used to place honey cakes on the altars of hertemples on her birthday. The cakes were round like the full moon. This custom was next recorded in the middleages when German peasants lit tapers on birthday cakes, thenumber lit indicating the person's age, plus an extra one torepresent the light of life. From earliest days burning tapershad been endued with mystical significance and it was believedthat when blown out they had the power to grant a secret wish andensure a happy year ahead. And the last tradition I would like totell you is called ""The 5th of November"". On the 5th of Novemberin almost every otwn and village in England you will see fireburning, fireworks, cracking and lighting up the sky. You willsee too small groups of children pulling round in a home madecart, a figure that looks something like a man but consists of anold suit of clothes, stuffed with straw. The children will sing: ""Remember, remember the 5th of November; Gun powder, treason andplot"". And they will ask passers-by for ""a penny for the Guy"" Butthe children with ""the Guy"" are not likely to know who or whatday they are celebrating. They have done this more or less every5th of November since 1605. At that time James the First was onthe throne. He was hated with many people especialy the Romancatholics against whom many sever laws had been passed. A numberof catholics chief of whom was Robert Catesby determined to killthe King and his ministers by blowing up the house of Parliamentwith gunpowder. To help them in this they got Guy Fawkes, asoldier of fortune, who would do the actual work. The day fixedfor attempt was the 5th of November, the day on which theParliament was to open. But one of the consperators had severalfriends in the parliament and he didn't want them to die. So hewrote a letter to Lord Monteagle begging him to make some excuseto be absent from parliament if he valued his life. LordMonteagle took the letter hurriedly to the King. Guards were sentat once to examine the cellars of the house of Parliament. Andthere they found Guy Fawkes about to fire a trail of gunpowder.He was tortured and hanged, Catesby was killed, resisting arrestin his own house. In memory of that day bonfires are stilllighted, fireworks shoot across the November sky and figures ofGuy Fawkes are burnt in the streets."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"On July, 4, 1776, a group of Americans representing the thirteen British colonies on the Atlantic coast of North America signed a document stating that these colonies had the right to be free and independent. This document is known as the Declaration of Independence. July 4 is celebrated by Americans as a national holiday — Independence Day. There is a building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which is called Independence Hall. Here the Declaration was signed. On the building there is the famous Liberty Bell which rang to tell people in the streets that a new country had been born. But Britain did not recognise this fact until1783, when the American colonists were victorious in the war of Independence with Britain. June, 14 is Flag Day in the USA. On that day in 1777, the Americans adopted their own flag. No one really knows who sewed the American flag but many Americans believe that it was made by Betsy Ross in her own home. You can see Betsy Ross sewing the flag on an American stamp."

Saint Patrick is one of the symbols of Ireland, in fact, he is considered the man who drew the country to Christianity. And he did it almost bloodless . The Irish began to celebrate the day of his death ( March 17) as a national holiday since the X or XI century, and during this time many legends and fables appeared, and it's celebration became rather fun ritual. The man we know as St. Patrick was actually born not in Ireland but in Britain, his real name is Mevin Sukkat. He was not Irish but British. His father came from a rich Roman family. In his youth Mevin didn't show much interest in religion, but everything changed when he was 16. At this age, he was captured by Irish pirates and sent into slavery by the leader of one of the Irish clans. For six years Mevin was a shepherd, at this time he went to God and earnestly prayed day and night. According to legend God helped him to escape from captivity and return home.

Activities in Ireland

Mevin went to Gaul to learn there in the monasteries after his return. According to legend, while in Gaul he had a vision in which he was ordered to sail to Ireland, in order to turn its population to Christianity. In Gaul Mevin was ordained bishop and given the name Patritsius. Curiously, at that time in Ireland lived a number of Christians and they needed a management bishop .Originally St. Patrick was met not too welcome, but further everything turned much better. The ability of St. Patrick to convince, knowledge of Irish traditions, and language skills played the great role in it.

Legends associated with the name of St. Patrick

There are several miracles connected with the name of St. Patrick. For example a man raised his sword, stood rooted to the spot until he became more friendly; the Easter fire that Patrick lit stayed on, despite all efforts of the Druids. The exile of snakes from the territory of the island was a miracle too. Another legend associated with the symbol of this day - a shamrock, it is believed that Patrick used it to convey the people the essence of the Trinity: God is one in three persons as well as the three leaf clover growing on one stalk.

Leprechauns are the funny St. Patrick's Day companions. They are the small fairy creatures that sew shoes for other mythical creatures. Leprechauns conceal somewhere their pot with treasure. Someone who will catch them, leprechaun must tell where the treasure is stored. Indispensable action of this day is a street parade, which is attended by orchestras and people in original and funny costumes. There is a tradition to paint ponds green in some American cities."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"There are only 6 public holidays in Great Britain. Those are days on which people need not go to work. These days are: Christmas Day, Boxing day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Spring Bank Holiday and Late Summer Bank Holiday. Most of these holidays are of religious origin, though it would be right to say that for the great part of the population they have lost their religious significance and are simply days on which people relax, drink and make merry. All public holidays, except Christmas day and Boxing day observed on December 25th and 26th respectively, are movable, that is don't fall on the same day each year. Christmas day observed on December 25th is the most popular public holiday of the year in all parts of Greeat Britain except Scotland. On Christmas Eve offices and public buildings close at one o'clock, but the shops stay open late. Most big cities, especially London, are decorated with Christmas trees and colored lights across the streets. Everybody wants to be at home for Christmas. At homes there's a great air of expectation. The children are decorating the tree, housewives are busy in the kitchen getting things ready for the next day's dinner. The Christmas food, nowadays usually turkey, is being prepared and stuffed. The chief Christmas tree is usually placed on Trafalgar Square, in front of the national Gallery, and it has become a tradition that the tree is a present from the people of Oslo. December 26th is called Boxing day because traditionally it was the day for people still give a ""Christmas box"" to the postman and milkman, but it's usually some money. This is the day when one visits friends, goes for a drive or a long walk or just sits around recovering from eating too much food. In the big cities and towns, tradition on that day demands a visit to the Christmas pantomime where one is entertained by the story of Cinderella, or Puss in Boots or whoever it may be. Easter is a religious holiday and Easter Monday is a bank holiday. Certain old traditions are observed, whenever it's celebrated as the start of spring or a religious festival. London greets the spring with a spectacular show, Easter Parade in Batter Sea Park on Easter Sunday each year. It is sponsored by the London, Tourist Board and is usually planned around a central theme related to the history and attractions of London. During the Easter Holidays the attention of the progressive people in Britain and indeed throughout the world stays focused. First and foremost on the Easter Peace Marches, which took place for the first time in 1958 and have since become traditional. Good Friday and Easter Monday depend on Easter Sunday, which falls on the 1st Sunday after a full Moon on or after March 21st. The Spring Bank Holiday falls on the last Monday of May or on the 1st Monday of June, while the Late Summer Bank Holiday comes on the last Monday in August or on the first Monday in September, depending on which of the Monday is nearer to June 1st and September 1st respectively. Besides public holidays, there are other festivals, anniversaries and simply days, for example Pancake Day and Bonfire High on which certain traditions are observed."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"St Valentine's Day comes on February 14. It is not a legal or a national holiday. Banks and offices are not closed, but it is a happy little festival for young people. It is widely celebrated among people of all ages by exchange of ""valentines"". A ""valentine"" may mean a special greeting-card or a little present. It may be for the person who receives the gift. St Valentine is the patron of sweethearts. February 14 is the anniversary of his death. The day is the time to send little gifts to those you love. Flowers and candy are favourite presents which sweethearts send to each other. Valentine candy is packed in red heart-shaped boxes and sold for this one day. Valentines are special greeting cards. They are often coloured red, have red trimmings and pictures of hearts. Some ""valentines"" are very fancy, they are trimmed with paper lace and little bows of paper ribbon. They have verses of love poetry printed on them. It is a good day for parties, especially by young people. The hosts trim the hall with red and white paper hearts. Refreshments are often coloured red, like red candy and punch. Sandwiches and cakes are often cut in the shape of hearts. Sometimes, a King and Queen of Hearts are chosen for the evening of dance."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Many great holidays and anniversaries are celebrated in our country. On the 1st of May there is May Day — the holiday of spring and labour. On the 8th of March there is Women's Day — the holiday of all women and girls. We celebrate Day of Independence of Russia on the 12th June and Day of Russian Constitution on the 12th of December. Now people celebrate some religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter. But my favourite holiday is New Year's Day, of course. It is a really wonderful holiday. People get ready for this holiday long before it. They buy New Year trees and decorate them. Every year a fairy-tale comes to every house and every family on New Year's Eve. Children and even grown-ups wait for this day because they believe that all their wishes and desires come true and different wonderful miracles happen on that day.

On New Year' s Eve people get together to see ""the old year out and the new year in"". They eat tasty food, drink champagne, dance and have a good time together. They wish each other happiness and good luck in the new year and put the presents under the New Year tree. Children like this holiday very much. They wait for New Year presents, which, they believe, Father Frost bring to them. Everybody is merry on that day and wishes the next year to be good and happy and all one's troubles and disappointments to remain in the past."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Almost every nation and country has a reputation of some kind. The Englishmen are reputed to be cold, reserved, easy-going and fond of sport. They are the nation of stay-at-homes. ""There is no place like home"", they say. The English man's home is his castle is a saying known all over the world. They prefer a small house built for one family, with a small garden are a fire in the centre of the house. They like animals very much and follow the traditions concerning food and meals. We know much about English traditions and customs but now I'd like to say a few words about the traditions of my native land - Russia.

To my mind, the main traits of their characters which differ them from other people are hospitality, their ""open heart"", ""golden hands"", wise Russian fairytales reflect this wisdom. Our people are hardworking, patient, never loosing hope for better life. The Russians are the talented nation. Russia gave the world beautiful names of Pushkin and Lermontov, Chaikovsky and Repin, thousands of names of world famous poets, writers, composers, scientists. All of them are the pride of the nation because they sand the beauty of our nature and people.

Besides these great names in literature and music, our country is famous for Russian traditional specific crafts its skilled craftsmen. Painted boxes of Palekh, coloured shawls of Pavlov Posad, clay toys of Dymkovo, laces of Vologda are known all over the world. The names of Gzhel and Khokhloma are considered to be the symbols of Russia as well as matryoshkas and samovars. The history of khokhloma goes back into the 17th century Producing of tableware-dishes, spoons, mugs was begun at that time in the villages of Suomino and Khokhloma in the Nizhniy Novgorod Province. On the banks of the great Russian river Volga. Many carpenters, painters have been working since then reviving traditions of old masters. The Khokhloma style is characterized by using plant elements in painting the tableware. The prevailing colours are black, yellow, golden, green and red. And nowadays this craft is sure to be saved, it will be developed and brought into the future by the new generation of painters. The reviving of old crafts is connected with the reviving of the traditional arts of all peoples inhabiting our big country. There are 100 of them. They revive their culture, costumes, dances and language. It is the revival of our souls. Now we celebrate the forgotten holidays - Troisa, Maslenitsa, Easter. We again sing Russian folk songs and chastushki, dance Barinya and perform khorovods, ride in troikas.

Traditional Russian cooking is world-famous for such dishes as okroshka, shi, pelmeny, kurnik, kvas.

We begin to build and reconstruct churches as well. The example of it is the building of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow. It is the symbol of reviving human feelings, national pride and patriotism."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Halloween, name applied to the evening of October 31, preceding the Christian feast of Hallowmas, Allhallows, or All Saints' Day. The observances connected with Halloween are thought to have originated among the ancient Druids, who believed that on that evening, Saman, the lord of the dead, called forth hosts of evil spirits. The Druids customarily lit great fires on Halloween, apparently for the purpose of warding off all these spirits. Among the ancient Celts, Halloween was the last evening of the year and was regarded as a propitious time for examining the portents of the future. The Celts also believed that the spirits of the dead revisited their earthly homes on that evening. After the Romans conquered Britain, they added to Halloween features of the Roman harvest festival held on November 1 in honor of Pomona, goddess of the fruits of trees. The Celtic tradition of lighting fires on Halloween survived until modern times in Scotland and Wales, and the concept of ghosts and witches is still common to all Halloween observances. Traces of the Roman harvest festival survive in the custom, prevalent in both the United States and Great Britain, of playing games involving fruit, such as ducking for apples in a tub of water. Of similar origin is the use of hollowed-out pumpkins carved to resemble grotesque faces and lit by candles placed inside"
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"There are many holydays in our country. They are New Year Day, Christmas and other. I'd like to tell you about my favorite holiday - New Year's Day.The weather is usually fine and cool and there is a lot of snow everywhere. Children don't go to school because of winter holidays.Our family prepares for this holydays before hand. My father buys and brings a beautiful New Year's Tree.

At 12 o'clock we sit at the table and say best wishes for the New Year. The New Year is always connected with our new plans and dreams. It is a pleasant moment to get presents on the New Year. At night we watch TV, dance, make jokes and go for a walk with my friends."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"There are a number of holidays, which are celebrated in Great Britain every year.

One of them is, of course, the New Year's Day on the first of January. It is not so popular in England as in our country, but it is rather popular in Scotland. On that day people usually visit their friends and there is a lot of dancing and eating. In Scotland people bring a piece of coal for good luck in the New Year.

The next holiday of the year is St. Valentine's Day. It is on the 14th of February. People buy or make Valentine cards and send them to the people they love.

In March there is Mother's Day. All the children and adults, come to their mothers on that day to express their love and gratitude.

,,,,,"leisure activities
holidays",,,,,,,,,"With the exception of breakfast meals in England are much the same as in other countries. The usual meals in Great Britain are breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner. The English are very fastidious about their meals and keep to their meal times strictly. Breakfast time is between 7 and 9 a. m. Many people like to begin it with porridge. English people eat porridge with milk or cream and sugar, but the Scots — and Scotland is the home of porridge — never put sugar in it. Then comes bacon and eggs, marmalade with toast and tea or coffee. For a change you can have a boiled egg, cold ham or perhaps fish. The two substantial meals of the day, lunch and dinner, are more or less the same. Lunch is usually taken at one o'clock. Many people, who go out to work, find it difficult to come home for lunch and go to a cafe or a restaurant, but they never miss a meal. Lunch is a big meal — meat or fish, potatoes and salad, puddings or fruit are quite usual for it. In the afternoon, about four o'clock, the English have a cup of tea and a cake, or a slice or two of bread and butter. Tea is very popular with the English; it may be called their national drink. The English like it strong and fresh made. Tea must be brewed as follows: one teaspoon for each person and one for the pot. They drink it with or without sugar, but almost always with milk. It is important to pour tea into milk, and not vice versa. Their ""high tea"" at 5 o'clock is very famous. Tea is accompanied by ham, tomatoes and salad, bread and butter, fruit and cakes. Dinnertime is generally about half past seven or later. In some houses dinner is the biggest meal of the day. They begin with soup, followed by fish, roast chicken, potatoes and vegetables, fruit and coffee. But in great many English homes the midday meal is the chief one of the day, and in the evening they only have light meal, for example, bread and cheese and a cup of coffee or cocoa and fruit."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"There are some public holidays when people all over the country do not work. The major holidays are: New Year's Day, Victory Day, May Day, Constitution Day, the Women's Day, Independence Day.

New Year`s Day
There is one holiday which is loved by everybody: children and adults. This is New Year. People decorate New Year trees with toys and lights. On the New Year night people go to a dance, visit their friends or stay at home and watch TV. It's my favorite holiday.

THE 8th OF MARCH (The Women's Day)
It is a happy and nice holiday. It is a good tradition in our country to give presents and flowers to women on this day. Each family celebrates this spring holiday. In the morning men go to the shops or markets to buy some flowers. They try to clean flats and help women to cook a holiday dinner. Sons and daughters help their mothers too. 
Some families celebrate the 8th of March going to the theatres and concerts. Others prefer to invite guests and stay at home.
All women try to be nice and happy on this day.

MAY DAY
The 1st of May is a spring holiday in our country. Usually it is warm during this day. The weather is fine. The trees are green. You can see some flowers in the parks and gardens. I don't go to school and my parents don't go to work on the 1st of May.

Victory Day
The greatest national holiday in our country is Victory Day. On the 9th of May we celebrate the anniversary of the victory over fascism in the World War II. Many veterans took part in the military parade.

Independence Day is a new holiday in our country. On the 12th of June, 1992, the first President of Russia was elected. 
We also celebrate Day of the Defender of Motherland on the 23d of February, Easter, Day of knowledge and lots of professional holidays."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"65 years have passed since the day of the Victory in the Great Patriotic war, but its echo till now doesn`t calm down in humans` souls. We haven`t the right to forget the horror of that war. We haven`t the right to forget those soldiers, who died for our bright future. We must remember everybody and everything. We must come down the memory about one of the most terrible war, which concerned every family, from father to son.
This war has left its sign in my family too. My great-grandfather is Shvakin Michael lived in the village Rybinskie Budy of Kursk region. He was called to defend the native land in 1941. When he went to the front, he had had a son and two small daughters; one of them was my grandmother. He fought in the infantry under the command of marshal Rokossovski. His 16 years old son Leonid was called up in 1942. As fate has willed it they both took part in the liberation of the town Konigsberg, but didn`t meet. The father and the son went the whole Europe and met the Victory day in Berlin. They were wounded and treated in hospital there, but didn`t meet again. They took part in the liberation of Poland, Czechoslovakia, the cities and towns of Germany.
My great-grandfather had many battle rewards. They are our family`s relic now.
So, I think Victory day was and must remain the lightest holiday. Our forefathers give us the opportunity to live under the peaceful sky now and we mustn`t forget about that. I`m proud of my great-grandfather. Thanks his and other simple soldiers daily feat of arms fascism was defeated!
We bow our thanks the simple soldier, but the real hero!"
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Almost in every culture in the world there is a celebration of thanks for rich harvest. The American Thanksgiving began as a feast of thanksgiving almost four hundred years ago.

In 1620, a religious community sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to settle in the New World. They settled in what is now known as the state of Massachusetts.Their first winter in America was difficult. They arrived too late to grow a rich harvest. Moreover, half the colony died from disease. The following spring the Iroquois Indians taught them how to grow corn. Indians showed them also how to grow other crops and how to hunt and fish.

In the autumn of 1621 they got a beautiful harvest of corn, barley, beans and pumpkins. The colonists had much to be thankful for, so they planned a feast. Local Indian chief and ninety Indians were present. The colonists learned from Indians how to cook cranberries and dishes of corn and pumpkins.

In following years many of the colonists celebrated the harvest with a feast of thanks. After the United States gained independence, Congress recommended one yearly day of thanksgiving for the whole country.

Later, George Washington suggested the date November 26 as Thanksgiving Day. Then, after the Civil war, Abraham Lincoln suggested the last Thursday in November to be the day of thanksgiving.

On Thanksgiving Day, family members gather at the house of an older relative, even if they live far away. All give thanks for everything good they have. Charitable organizations offer traditional meal to the homeless.

Foods, eaten at the first thanksgiving, have become traditional. The traditional thanksgiving meal consists of roast turkey stuffed with herb-flavoured bread, cranberry jelly, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie. Other dishes may vary as to region: ham, sweet potatoes, creamed corn."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Father's Day comes on the third Sunday in June. It is not a national holiday on that day. Americans honour their fathers. Many people send their fathers a card or a gift. Americans are great letter-writers. Whatever happens in a family, they congratulate all the members. They congratulate people on Easter, Christmas and Whitsun. They do not have to possess great literary talent themselves, because one can find printed texts for all possible occasions. One may select and check any of these suggested texts: ""Here's to Father: always loved, respected, and admired"". ""Warmest wishes for your happiness on Father's Day and ever after"". About 1909, the churches of Spokane, Washington, set aside the day to honour fathers. The custom soon spread throughout the United States and Canada. During the autumn, some colleges celebrate Dad's Day. They set aside a Saturday during the football season. On Dad's Day, they honour the fathers among the members and friends of the college."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Americans share three national holidays with many countries: Easter Sunday, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day.

Easter, which falls on a spring Sunday that varies from year to year, celebrates the Christian belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. For Christians, Easter is a day of religious services and the gathering of family. Many Americans follow old traditions of coloring hard-boiled eggs and giving children baskets of candy.

Christmas Day, December 25, is another Christian holiday; it marks the birth of the Christ Child. Decorating houses and yards with lights, putting up Christmas trees, giving gifts, and sending greeting cards have become traditions even for many non-Christian Americans.

New Year's Day, of course, is January 1. The celebration of this holiday begins the night before, when Americans gather to wish each other a happy and prosperous coming year."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Uniquely American Holidays

Eight other holidays are uniquely American (although some of them have counterparts in other nations). For most Americans, two of these stand out above the others as occasions to cherish national origins: Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July.

Thanksgiving Day is the fourth Thursday in November. The holiday dates back to 1621, the year after the Puritans arrived in Massachusetts, determined to practice their dissenting religion without interference.

After a rough winter, in which about half of them died, they turned for help to neighboring Indians, who taught them how to plant corn and other crops. The next fall's bountiful harvest inspired the Pilgrims to give thanks by holding a feast. The Thanksgiving feast became a national tradition.To this day, Thanksgiving dinner almost always includes some of the foods served at the first feast: roast turkey, cranberry sauce, potatoes, pumpkin pie. Before the meal begins, families or friends usually pause to give thanks for their blessings, including the joy of being united for the occasion.

The Fourth of July, or Independence Day, honors the nation's birthday - the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. It is a day of picnics and patriotic parades, a night of concerts and fireworks.

Besides Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July, there are six other uniquely American holidays: Martin Luther King Day, Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day. While not holidays, two other days of the year inspire colorful celebrations in the United States: February 14, Valentine's Day, and October 31, Halloween."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"There are many holidays in the USA which are celebrated from year to year. American people enjoy having holidays, especially if they are public. During such holidays children don’t go to school and adults don’t work.

Perhaps, the most favourite public holidays in the USA are Christmas and New Year. Christmas season starts on December the 25th and continues till New Year celebrations. Many families arrange parties on New Year’s Eve. It’s also the time of present exchange.

Another important American holiday is Independence Day, which is celebrated every year on July the 4th. This holiday celebrates the day when the Declaration of Independence was signed in Philadelphia. The exact date was July the 4th, 1776.

Thanksgiving Day is another interesting American holiday. It is celebrated every fourth Thursday of November. At this time in 1621 the Pilgrim Fathers celebrated their first harvest festival in America. Since then Americans always celebrate Thanksgiving to thank God for their harvest. There is one more interesting autumn holiday in the USA. It’s the Day of All Saints, known in the world as Halloween. Children are especially fond of this holiday. It is celebrated on October 31st. Typical Halloween activities include trick-or-treating, dressing up in different costumes, craving pumpkins into jack-o-lanterns, telling scary stories, etc.

November 11th is Veteran’s Day in the USA. This holiday is dedicated to people who fell courageously in the World Wars. There is one special holiday which is celebrated by Americans on February 22nd. It’s Washington’s Birthday. This day is also known as President’s Day. George Washington was the first president of the USA, so he is dearly respected by American nation."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"The population of the USA is made up of people of different nationalities. Centuries ago they brought with them their native celebrations. Some holidays which are marked in the United States originated in America. The number of holidays is different in different states - from 8 in the District of Columbia to 20 in Oklahoma. But the most important holidays are celebrated throughout the USA. They are: New Year’s Day (January 1), Lincoln’s Birthday (February 12), Washington’s Birthday (February 22), Independence Day (July 4), Thanksgiving Day (fourth Thursday in November), Christmas (December 25). Here are a few words about them.
On New Year’s Day people see the old year off and the New Year in. Most people stay up all night, even children. At midnight many people go outside and shout «Happy New Year»! Some people set off fireworks and blow automobile horns which are heard everywhere. Everybody exchanges presents and good wishes. Offices, factories, banks and stores do not work on this day.
Lincoln’s birthday is celebrated every year on February 12. Abraham Lincoln was President during the Civil War (1861-1865) He led the fight to keep the nation together and to free the slaves. His life ended tragically. He was killed at the theatre during the performance soon after the victory of the North. In honour of this great man a beautiful memorial has been built in Washington, D.C. Lincoln’s birthday is celebrated every year on February 12.
Washington’s birthday is marked on February 22. George Washington led the American Army to victory in the War for Independence. Later he was elected President of the United States and was in office for 8 years (1789-1797). The national capital of the United States, a state and several towns are named after George Washington.
One of the greatest holidays is Independence Day. On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was signed. It proclaimed independence of the thirteen British colonies from Great Britain. July 4 has become the greatest holiday since. In the past this day was marked with big parades and fireworks, but now it is celebrated more quietly. Cities and towns are decorated with flags on that day, there are parades in some places, but most people just go on picnics to the countryside.
Labour Day is celebrated on the first Monday in September. On this day workers make a public show with marches, meetings, etc. It also marks the beginning of the school year and the end of summer.
Thanksgiving Day is marked on the fourth Thursday of November. On this day the Americans honour the memory of the first settlers. It also marks the end of the harvest season. It is a long-standing tradition to make a festive meal with a fried turkey on this day.
Christmas is a religious holiday which symbolizes the birth of Jesus Christ. By this day people decorate fir trees with toys and candies. Children wait for Santa Claus who comes to every house and brings them presents. Before going to bed, children leave their shoes to find in them what they want most of all the next morning. Some people, especially young people, like to celebrate it in restaurants and cafes and pubs, but most people prefer to stay at home with their family on this day."

Holidays in the U.S.A. discusses the ten federally-recognized holidays in the United States, as well as many celebratory days such as Valentine's Day and Mother's Day that are commonly celebrated. There is also a section addressing four recognition months that are commonly acknowledged in the USA: Black History Month, Women's History Month, Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, and Hispanic Heritage Month."
,,,,,family,,,,,,,,,"A logical extension of the above is discussing your family. How many people are in your family? Mother, father, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles, cousins? If anyone is divorced or remarried, do you have step-parents or siblings? Who is the oldest sibling, and the youngest? This is great for learning the words for various relatives and for explaining the family relationship words like son, daughter, nephew, cousin, etc."

,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Each of the 59 American states established its own holidays. The federal government, through the President and Congress, can legally set holidays only for federal employees and for the District of Columbia. Most states, however, accept the federal legal holidays. Holidays for all federal offices, most state and local government offices, and many (not all) businesses, are:
New Year’s Day (January 1)
Martin Luther King’s birthday (third Monday in January)
Washington’s Birthday, sometimes called «President’s Day» (third Monday in February)
Memorial Day (last Monday in May)
Independence Day (July 4)
Labor Day (first Monday in September)
Columbus Day (second Monday in October)
Veteran’s Day (November 11)
Thanksgiving Day (fourth Thursday in November)
Christmas Day (December 25)
Most states have holidays which are observed, but are not necessary «legal». The name of the holiday (e.g. Confederate Memorial Day) goes on the calendar (last Monday in April) for a state (Alabama, Mississippi), yet this does not mean that businesses are always closed or children let out of school. President or Congress may proclaim a special day or week in order to bring attention to a certain concern, interest group, or problem.
The many religious holidays such as Good Friday, Hanukkah, or Ramadan are observed, of course, by the religious, but they have no national or official legal status. Rather, each state sets its own laws, and whether or not an employee is given time off also depends on labour agreements.
There are many traditional holidays, observed by a large number оf Americans, which are also neither legal nor official. Among these are St. Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day (not just people with Irish roots celebrate it), Mother’s Day and Halloween Day (the last day of October).
The three holidays which were first observed in the US, but have now spread elsewhere are Labor Day (May 1), Thanksgiving, and Mother’s Day.
Perhaps the two «most American» of the holidays are the Fourth of July - Independence Day and Thanksgiving. The Fourth of July is the day of signing the Declaration of Independence. It is like a big, nationwide birthday party. Some towns and cities have parades with bands and flags. The nation’s birthday is also the nation’s greatest annual summer party.
Thanksgiving is a day for families to come together. Traditional foods are prepared for the feast - turkey or ham, corn dishes, breads and rolls, and a pumpkin pie. At the same time, Thanksgiving is a solemn occasion, a day to remember the many who are less well off, in America and throughout the world."

I have also to say that Americans celebrate holidays which are observed in many countries of the world. Among these are Christmas, which is celebrated on December 25, New Year's Day, January 1, and Easter, which always falls on Sunday.

But there is one peculiar holiday, which isn't celebrated in our republic - Presidents' Day. Presidents' Day is an old national holiday. For a long time it was observed on February 22, the birthday of George Washington, first president of the USA. In the majority of states Americans also celebrate Abraham Lincoln's birthday on February 12. In the 1970s the American Congress decided to honour all past presidents of a country on a single day which was called Presidents' Day, and which is observed on the third Monday in February every year, when the Americans honour the dead. They remember the dead of all wars and all other dead. Special ceremonies are held in cemeteries, at monuments for the war dead, in churches, schools, or other public places. 


Christmas is a very great religious holiday. Today there are a lot of Christmas traditions which are very popular, for example, to give presents to the children with the help of Santa Claus, who is said to live at the North Pole, where he makes toys for children during the whole year. Grown-ups also exchange presents and Christmas greeting cards. Americans decorate their homes for Christmas. They have a Christmas tree, which they decorate with toys and small lights. The tree may be a real fir tree from the forest or an artificial one.

Christmas is also a time when Americans do a lot of charity work. They help the people, organize Christmas dinners for the homeless people. During Christmas you can meet a lot of people in the streets who collect money for those who are in need.

There are a lot of other holidays: Independence Day, Labour Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Martin Luter King's Day, etc.

But I think that Halloween is the most unusual among them. Halloween is a festival that takes place on October 31. In the USA children wear costumes and masks and go trick-or-treating. Many of them carve jack-o'-lanterns out of pumpkins. Fortunetelling and storytelling about ghosts and witches is popular activity that day.

Halloween developed from New Year festivals and festivals of the dead. Christian church established a festival on November 1 called All Saint's Day so that people could continue to celebrate their festivals.

Jack-o'-lanterns are hollowed-out pumpkins with face carved into one side. Most jack-o'-lanterns contain a candle inside. An Irish legend says that jack-o'-lanterns are named after the man called Jack. He could not enter heaven because he was a miser, and he could not enter hell because he had played jokes on devil. As a result, Jack has to walk on the earth with his Lantern until Judgment Day.


 

Fortunetelling is an important part of Halloween. For example, a coin, a ring, and a thimble were baked into a cake. It was believed that the person who found the coin would become wealthy. The one who found the ring would marry soon. And the person who found the thimble would never get married. Today people practice card reading and palmistry.

People once believed that there were many ghosts and witches on the Earth and that they met on October 31 to worship the devil. Today, people don't believe in ghosts and withes but they like to tell stories about them on Halloween.

And in the end it's necessary to say that Americans as all other nations have their own peculiar holidays that deserve our attention. "
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"There are federal holidays in the USA when the government offices and some private businesses are closed, and American people enjoy their days off. The national favorites are Christmas and Thanksgiving Day. Christmas Day is celebrated on the 25th of December. People put up Christmas trees, decorate their homes and gardens, send greeting cards, exchange gifts and attend church services. Children wait for Santa Claus to come to their houses from the chimney and leave presents under the tree or inside their socks. Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on the last Thursday of November. In 1621, after a long hungry winter and severe epidemics, the Pilgrims gathered their first bountiful harvest and they held a feast which has become a national tradition since then. Today American families gather together at their parents’ places and serve a large home-cooked dinner: roast turkey with cranberry sauce, a pumpkin pie and potatoes.

There are some other national holidays in the USA. The 4th of July is Independence Day which honors the adoption of the national Declaration of independence in 1776. On Veterans’ Day (the 11th of November) and Memorial Day (the 30th of May) the USA honor American veterans and killed servicemen of all wars. Columbus Day is celebrated on the second Monday of October and it commemorates the landing of Christopher Columbus in the New World in 1492. Labor Day is also a federal holiday on the first Monday of September when working people hold parades to mark the end of summer. President’s Day (or Washington’s Birthday) is celebrated on the 22nd of February and it honors the first president of the USA.

Some American holidays are also observed in many countries of the world. Among them are St. Valentine’s Day (sweethearts and lovers of all ages exchange special greeting cards “valentines” and small presents on the 14th of February to express their love and affection), Halloween (on the 31st of October Americans carve jack-o-lanterns out of pumpkins and wear scary costumes and masks to frighten off devils, ghosts and witches) and New Year’s Day (the night before the 1st of January Americans stay awake and gather to watch fireworks and shoot off firecrackers, make traditional New Year’s resolutions and wish each other a happy coming year).

There are some other popular American celebrations that happen every year: Easter (which falls on Sunday in March or April), Mother’s Day (the second Sunday in May) and Father’s Day (the third Sunday in June)."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"The schedule of public holidays in the United States is largely influenced by the schedule of federal holidays but is controlled by private sector employers who provide 62% of the total U.S. population with paid time off.[citation needed]

Public holidays with paid time off is generally defined to occur on a day that is within the employee's work week. When a holiday occurs on Saturday or Sunday, that holiday is shifted to either Friday or Monday for work purposes. Most employers follow a holiday schedule similar to the federal holidays of the United States, with exceptions or additions. The federal holiday schedule mainly benefits employees of government and government regulated businesses; however, this sector only comprises 15% of the working population.

At the discretion of the employer, other non-federal holidays such as New Year's Eve, Christmas Eve and the Day after Thanksgiving are common additions to the list of paid holidays while Columbus Day and Veterans Day are common omissions. Besides paid holidays, there are festival and food holidays that also have wide acceptance based on sales of goods and services that are typically associated with that holiday. Halloween and Valentine's Day are examples of widely celebrated uncompensated holidays."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Public holidays had their origins from established federal holidays that were enacted by Congress. They were typically observed on days that have significance for various sectors of American society and are observed at all levels of society, including government and the private sector. These holidays are typically derived from the history, religions, and cultures of the United States and have changed over time. Major holidays are most commonly observed with paid time off, however, many other holiday celebrations come without time off.

There are no national holidays on which the law requires all businesses to close. Federal holidays are only established for certain federally chartered and regulated businesses, government contractors, and the city of Washington, DC. All other public holidays are created by the States; most states also allow local jurisdictions (cities, villages, etc.) to establish their own local holidays. As a result, holidays have not historically been governed at the federal level and federal law does not govern business openings.

Some states, however, do restrict certain business activities on some holidays.[1] Business closures are mandated on a few holidays in some states for certain kinds of businesses by blue laws. For example, businesses that operate on more than 5,000 square feet (460 m2) cannot open on Thanksgiving in some New England states. The most notable businesses to close on such occasions are car dealerships and liquor stores. Some holidays are observed with community service, depending on the meaning of the holiday. Service is, however, not mandated by any government agencies, whether they be federal, state, or local."

Overview[edit]
As of June 2021, there are eleven annual federal holidays in the United States, and one additional quadrennial holiday (Inauguration Day).[2] Pursuant to the Uniform Monday Holiday Act of 1968 (effective 1971), official holidays are observed on a Monday, except for New Year's Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.[3]

While all current federal holidays have also been made public holidays in all 50 states, each state is not bound to observe the holidays on the same dates as the federal holidays. Many states also have additional holidays that are not observed by the federal government.[4] Many businesses likewise observe certain holidays as well, which are also not mandated by any government agency.


Saint Patrick's Day parade in Atlanta, 2012
Since 2000, some city and state-level celebrations of Malcolm X Day and Rosa Parks Day have been created, in addition to the federal Martin Luther King Jr. Day, to embrace the African American community in the form of festivals and parades. Illinois and Berkeley, California are two places where Malcolm X is honored by a legal holiday with offices closed, whereas Missouri honors Rosa Parks on her birthday.[5][6] Today, the United States is the 85th most ethnically diverse country in the world. Many workplaces celebrate religious observance as well as ethnic holidays, such as Saint Patrick's Day, Kwanzaa, Diwali, Mardi Gras, and Cinco de Mayo, as a matter of best practice.[7]

While the popularity of each public holiday cannot easily be measured, the holiday with the highest greeting card sales is Christmas.[8] Major retail establishments, such as shopping malls and centers, close only on Thanksgiving and Christmas, but remain open on all other holidays (with early closings on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, and sometimes on other major holidays). In the face of a rapidly tightening retail market in the 2010s, retailers have increasingly been opening on Thanksgiving evening and night to extend Black Friday and the holiday shopping season.[9] Virtually all large companies observe and close on the major holidays (New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas). Some non-retail businesses close on the day after Thanksgiving, while others (such as federal banks and post offices) are not allowed to close that day. Some smaller businesses normally open on Sundays will close on Easter Sunday if they expect to have very few customers that day.["

Religious and cultural holidays in the United States are characterized by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices. However, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...."" and Article VI specifies that ""no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."" As a result, various religious faiths have flourished, as well as perished, in the United States. A majority of Americans report that religion plays a ""very important"" role in their lives, a proportion unique among developed nations.[44]

The majority of Americans (73–80%) identify themselves as Christians and about 15–20% have no religious affiliation.[45] According to the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) (2008) 76% of the American adult population identified themselves as Christians, with 51% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant or unaffiliated, and 25% professing Catholic beliefs.[46] The same survey says that other religions (including, for example, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 4% of the adult population, another 15% of the adult population claim no religious affiliation, and 5.2% said they did not know, or they refused to reply. According to a 2012 survey by the Pew forum, 36 percent of Americans state that they attend services nearly every week or more."

The major Islamic holidays of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha have been recognized in the United States. Awareness of these holidays can be found in calendars published by major calendar manufacturers.[85][86][87] According to Al-Jazeera, schools in New York and Michigan (mainly Dearborn) may begin to close in observance of all Muslim holidays.[88]

The religious Eid is a single day and Muslims are not permitted to fast on that day. The holiday celebrates the conclusion of the 29 or 30 days of dawn-to-sunset fasting during the entire month of Ramadan. The day of Eid, therefore, falls on the first day of the month of Shawwal. This is a day when Muslims around the world show a common goal of unity. The date for the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on the observation of new moon by local religious authorities, so the exact day of celebration varies by locality.

It honors the willingness of Abraham (Ibrahim) to sacrifice his young first-born son Ishmael (Ismail)a as an act of submission to God's command, before God then intervened to provide Abraham with a lamb to sacrifice instead.[98] In the lunar-based Islamic calendar, Eid al-Adha falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah and lasts for four days.[99] In the international Gregorian calendar, the dates vary from year to year, drifting approximately 11 days earlier each year."

Confederate States of America[edit]
The following holidays memorialize the historic Confederate States of America from the American Civil War:

Confederate Memorial Day is a public holiday observed by Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina, Louisiana[citation needed] and Texas and an unofficially observed holiday in some other states. It is often in late April to align with the final surrender of the last Confederate Army. Texas observes Confederate Heroes Day.
Confederate History Month has been declared at least once in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia as well as by various cities, usually in April to augment Confederate Memorial Day.
Robert E. Lee Day (on or around Lee's Jan 19 birthday) is still observed in Alabama and Mississippi combined with Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the only remaining states to do so.[100] It is officially recognised in Florida, but is not widely observed there.[101]
Arkansas combined the observance of Robert E. Lee Day with Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1985.[102] In 2017, it passed a law removing Lee's name from the January holiday and instead establishing a state memorial day on the second Saturday of October in honor of Lee.[103]"

According to the National Institutes of Health, about 86% of the population over 18 drinks alcohol recreationally or socially.[104] In the United States, the holidays that are considered the most ""festive"" are generally regarded as some of the ""most drunken holidays."" Celebrations usually revolve around barbecues and beer. Although many of these holidays lack any official status, they are generally observed by the drinking culture for the fact that these holidays revolve around drinking. One measurement of the popularity of these holidays is the amount of alcohol purchased for the occasion. One survey names New Year's Eve as the holiday on which the most alcohol is consumed based on sales.[105] While many holidays are listed, some are generally notable for their drinking requirement while others are known for abstinence.[106]"

African Americans make up about 12% of the U.S. population. While some customs have come from abroad, many of the customs were developed inside the United States. Kwanzaa, for example, is a custom that has greatly influenced American culture originating from the ""turbulent 60's"" when race relations in the United States were at their lowest.[107] Most of the newer holidays revolve around a particular civil rights activist and have recently gained attention from city and state-level governments. At the federal level, there are only three national holidays named for a person, and one of those honors 20th century African American Martin Luther King Jr.; the other two are Washington's Birthday (for George Washington, one of the original American citizens of 1776) and Columbus Day (for Italian Christopher Columbus's European discovery of the Americas in 1492)."

The celebration honors African heritage in African-American culture, and is observed from December 26 to January 1, culminating in a feast and gift-giving.[109] Kwanzaa has seven core principles (Nguzo Saba). It was created by Maulana Karenga and was first celebrated in 1966–67.

In addition to the federal/national holidays, many religious, ethnic, and other traditional holidays populate the calendar, as well as lighter celebrations. These are rarely observed by businesses as holidays (Except for Easter and most often also on Good Friday);[10] indeed, many are viewed as opportunities for commercial promotion. Because of this commercialization, some critics apply the deprecatory term Hallmark holiday to such days, after the Hallmark greeting card company.

New Year’s Day in the United States is a time for fresh beginnings: hope
for a better future and resolutions to improve one’s behavior.
Observed January 1, New Year’s celebrations actually begin the night of December 31 with par- ties, concerts, fireworks and spe- cial events of all kinds. The day is marked in many American towns and cities with parades and U.S.- style football games.
In some communities the first baby to be born on New Year’s Day is honored with gifts and media coverage. The New Year itself is often symbolized by a baby wear- ing just a diaper, a festive hat and a sash imprinted with the year. In contrast, the concluding
“old year” is depicted by illustrations of “Father Time,” an old, white- bearded man in a robe, carrying an hourglass and a scythe.

beginnings — one face looks forward and the other backward. January is named for Janus.
In the United States today, the first of January remains a time to reflect on the year just completed. Newspapers and television shows review the main events of the pre- vious year and memorialize famous people who died.
New Year’s Day abounds with rituals and supersti- tions brought to the United States by immigrants. For example, it is considered good luck to eat black-eyed peas on New Year’s Day in southern states, a tradition with roots in Asia and Africa. Cabbage and sauer- kraut, to represent prosperity and long life, are Eastern European contributions to New Year’s dinner.
Immigrants of various nationalities believed that loud noises — firecrackers or gunfire — drive away the bad spirits of the past year and ensure a new year free of evil. “Shooting away bad spirits” became so popular with early Americans that by the mid-1700s some localities banned it to minimize the noise and the danger. But noise to herald the New Year remains ingrained in New Year’s celebrations, in the form of fireworks, whistles and party noisemakers.
New York City famously counts down to the mid- night hour in Times Square, where thousands gather to watch a faceted crystal ball drop at the appointed hour. The tradition dates from 1907.
People sing “Auld Lang Syne,” lyrics from Scottish poet Robert Burns set to an old folk tune, to usher in the New Year. It is a widespread custom to toast the New Year with champagne. Another custom is kissing a loved one at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve.
Millions of flowers are used to fabricate parade floats for the Tournament of Roses Parade, staged annually since 1890 in Pasadena, California, on New Year’s Day. The Rose Bowl collegiate football game usually follows the parade. Viewing the parade and game on television is a long-established New Year pastime.
Customs adopted from the diverse immigrant cultures of Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America enhance annual New Year celebrations, which are enjoyed by all, across the United States.

,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Black History Month Honors Legacy of Struggle and Triumph

Each February, National African American History Month honors the struggles and triumphs of millions of American citizens over the most devastating obstacles — slavery, prejudice, poverty — as well as their contributions to the nation’s cultural and political life.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, African Americans make up about 14 percent of the U.S. population and comprise the second-largest minority group, after Hispanics.

The election of Barack Obama, America’s first African-American president, continues to lend Black History Month a special significance. In his inaugural address, President Obama acknowledged the historical importance of a moment in which “a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.”

HONORING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF BLACK AMERICANS
National African American History Month was the inspiration of Carter G. Woodson, a noted scholar and historian, who instituted Negro History Week in 1926. He chose the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and the abolitionist Frederick Douglass.
The celebration was expanded to a month in 1976, the nation’s bicentennial. President Gerald R. Ford urged Americans to“seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.”

Carter G. Woodson, the son of former slaves in Virginia, realized that the struggles and achievements of Americans of African descent were being ignored or misrepresented. He founded the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), which supports historical research, publishes a scholarly journal and sets the theme for Black History Month each year.

John Fleming, ASALH president from 2007 to 2009 and director emeritus of the Cincinnati Museum Center, said President Obama’s heritage — a black father born in Kenya and a white mother born in the United States — “continues to reflect the contributions Africans and Europeans have made to American history from the very beginning.”

Fleming said he believes National African American History Month should focus on positive as well as negative aspects of the black experience. “Certainly, struggle has been an ongoing theme in our history from the very beginning. However, we were not slaves prior to being captured in Africa — and while slavery was part of our experience for 250 years, we have a hundred-and-some years in freedom that we also need to deal with.”

He said he has seen “substantial progress on many fronts,” but “at the same time there are still major problems that have to be addressed, one being the permanent underclass in urban areas now. We don’t seem to be able to break that cycle of poverty. And there are still some major rural pockets of poverty”such as in the Mississippi Delta.

“I think that African-American history gets more attention during February than during any other time of year, “ Fleming said, “and I think it’s an opportunity for us in the field to emphasize that it is something that should be studied throughout the year.”

Each year, the U.S. president honors Black History Month, or African-American History Month as it is also called, with a proclamation and a celebration at the White House. States and cities hold their own events around the country, and media feature topics related to black history.

ASALH has its headquarters in Washington, where Woodson lived from 1915 until his death in 1950. His home is designated a national historic site.

In 2003, President George W. Bush signed legislation to establish the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, which will be located on the National Mall near the Washington Monument."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Washington’s Birthday is a U.S. fed- eral holiday celebrated on the third Monday of February in honor of George Washington, the first presi- dent of the United States. Increas- ingly, the holiday has become an occasion to celebrate the birthdays of both President George Washing- ton and President Abraham Lin- coln. Many Americans call the holiday Presidents Day.
George Washington
eorge Washington was born on February 22, 1732, on his father’s
tobacco plantation in Colonial Virginia. He worked as a surveyor
on the Virginia frontier and then became a major in the Virginia militia. After serving heroically during the French and Indian War, he returned to his family’s Virginia home, Mount Vernon, and became a successful planter.
In 1775, when the American War for Independence broke out between the colonies and Great Britain, Washington was unanimously selected by the Continental Congress as com- mander in chief of the Continental Army. His small band of soldiers faced a well-equipped, profes- sional army, but he led his often ragged forces to victory in the
face of incredible hardships. The British surrendered at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781. In 1976, the U.S.

Presidents Day
Congress posthumously promoted Washington to the rank of six-star general, assuring that he would forever outrank all other members of the military.
Washington enjoyed nearly univer- sal respect, not least for spurning all offers of political power at the moment of his military triumph. He instead chose to return to pri- vate life at Mount Vernon. In 1787 he presided over the writing of the U.S. Constitution, and once it was ratified, he became the unanimous choice to be the first president of the United States. He served two four-year terms, from 1789 to 1797. At the end of his second term, Washington was the most popular figure in America and could have continued as president, but he relinquished power, thereby set- ting a precedent for his successors.
abraham lincoln
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, and became America’s 16th president in 1860. As president he guided his coun- try through a great constitutional, military and moral crisis — the American Civil War (1861–1865) — after 11 of 15 Southern slave- holding states seceded from the United States to form the Confederate States of America. His Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, out- lawed slavery in the Confederate states still in rebellion. The proc- lamation changed the war from a conflict over states’ rights to a war whose aims included the destruc- tion of slavery. Lincoln believed that a constitutional amendment

 was necessary to ensure the end of slavery, and he supported pas- sage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which was adopted in December 1865. Lincoln was shot to death by a Confederate sym- pathizer on April 9, 1865, five days after the Confederacy surrendered.
Honoring Both Presidents
February 22 was celebrated as a hol- iday by 19th-century Americans. At least a dozen states officially celebrate the third Monday in February as “Washington and Lincoln’s Birthday,” and another dozen states call it “Presidents Day.” In 1971, Congress fixed Washington’s Birthday and several other holidays on Mondays to cre- ate long holiday weekends.
As much as both Washington and Lincoln are revered, the fed- eral holiday officially remains
Washington’s Birthday. The first president is also honored with many statues around the coun- try and the 555-foot-high (169- meter) Washington Monument in the nation’s capital, Washington. Likenesses of both Washington and Lincoln are carved in stone on Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, along with Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt.
The holiday is also a tribute to the general who created the first mili- tary badge of merit for the common soldier. Revived on Washington’s 200th birthday in 1932, the Purple Heart medal (which bears Washington’s image) is awarded to soldiers who are injured in battle. As with Memorial Day and Veterans Day, Washington’s Birthday offers another opportu- nity for the United States to honor its veterans.February 2012"
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Why March is National Women’s History Month?

Local Celebrations

Women’s History Month – As recently as the 1970’s, women’s history was virtually an unknown topic in the K-12 curriculum or in general public consciousness. To address this situation, the Education Task Force of the Sonoma County (California) Commission on the Status of Women initiated a “Women’s History Week” celebration for 1978.

The week March 8th, International Women’s Day, was chosen as the focal point of the observance. The local Women’s History Week activities met with enthusiastic response, and dozens of schools planned special programs for Women’s History Week. Over one-hundred community women participated by doing special presentations in classrooms throughout the country and an annual “Real Woman” Essay Contest drew hundreds of entries. The finale for the week was a celebratory parade and program held in the center of downtown Santa Rosa, California.

Mobilizing a Movement

In 1979, Molly Murphy MacGregor, a member of our group, was invited to participate in The Women’s History Institute at Sarah Lawrence College, which was chaired by noted historian, Gerda Lerner and attended by the national leaders of organizations for women and girls. When the participants learned about the success of the Sonoma County’s Women’s History Week celebration, they decided to initiate similar celebrations within their own organizations, communities, and school districts. They also agreed to support an effort to secure a “National Women’s History Week.”

Presidential and Congressional Support

The first steps toward success came in February 1980 when President Carter issued the first Presidential Proclamation declaring the Week of March 8th 1980 as National Women’s History Week. In the same year, Representative Barbara Mikulski, who at the time was in the House of Representatives, and Senator Orrin Hatch co-sponsored a Congressional Resolution for National Women’s History Week 1981. This co-sponsorship demonstrated the wide-ranging political support for recognizing, honoring, and celebrating the achievements of American women.

A National Lobbying Effort

As word spread rapidly across the nation, state departments of education encouraged celebrations of National Women’s History Week as an effective means to achieving equity goals within classrooms. Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Oregon, Alaska, and other states developed and distributed curriculum materials for all of their public schools. Organizations sponsored essay contests and other special programs in their local areas. Within a few years, thousands of schools and communities were celebrating National Women’s History Week, supported and encouraged by resolutions from governors, city councils, school boards, and the U.S. Congress.

Each year, the dates of National Women’s History Week, (the week of March 8th) changed and every year a new lobbying effort was needed. Yearly, a national effort that included thousands of individuals and hundreds of educational and women’s organizations was spearheaded by the National Women’s History Project.

National Women’s History Month

By 1986, 14 states had already declared March as Women’s History Month. This momentum and state-by-state action was used as the rational to lobby Congress to declare the entire month of March 1987 as National Women’s History Month. In 1987, Congress declared March as National Women’s History Month in perpetuity. A special Presidential Proclamation is issued every year which honors the extraordinary achievements of American women.

Presidential Message 1980

President Jimmy Carter’s Message to the nation designating March 2-8, 1980 as National Women’s History Week.

“From the first settlers who came to our shores, from the first American Indian families who befriended them, men and women have worked together to build this nation. Too often the women were unsung and sometimes their contributions went unnoticed. But the achievements, leadership, courage, strength and love of the women who built America was as vital as that of the men whose names we know so well.

As Dr. Gerda Lerner has noted, “Women’s History is Women’s Right.” – It is an essential and indispensable heritage from which we can draw pride, comfort, courage, and long-range vision.”

I ask my fellow Americans to recognize this heritage with appropriate activities during National Women’s History Week, March 2-8, 1980.

I urge libraries, schools, and community organizations to focus their observances on the leaders who struggled for equality – – Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth, Lucy Stone, Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Harriet Tubman, and Alice Paul. Understanding the true history of our country will help us to comprehend the need for full equality under the law for all our people.

This goal can be achieved by ratifying the 27th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states that “Equality of Rights under the Law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.”"
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"U.S. Independence Day Celebration
The founders of the United States knew that inde- pendence was something
to celebrate. And although U.S. Independence Day celebrations have evolved over time, July 4th festivities remain an important part of American life.
But Independence Day wasn’t supposed to be on July 4.
In the spring of 1775, after more than a decade of agita- tion against British policies and the first battles of the War for Independence, the 13 American
colonies sent representatives to the first Continental Congress in Philadelphia. After much debate about severing ties with Britain, the representatives voted unani- mously for independence on July 2, 1776.

Independence Day
their decision to the world. So two days after its momentous vote, the Continental Congress approved the Declaration of Independence and sent copies throughout the fledgling country. The declaration bore the date of July 4, which the new nation embraced as Independence Day.
Adams was right about the ways Americans would celebrate. Even as the new nation fought to make independence a reality, July 4 was quickly marked by parades, con- certs, dinners and fireworks. The 1777 celebration in Philadelphia included music by a band of Hessian soldiers — mercenaries fighting for Britain who had been taken prisoner the previous winter.
Parades to celebrate Independence Day began as military displays but quickly became democratic affairs. The 1788 parade in Philadelphia was more than a mile long, with horse-drawn floats and workers of all kinds marching in costume.
Rowdy Celebrations Quiet Down
The ways in which Americans mark July 4 have quieted down, accord- ing to James Heintze, a retired

 American University librarian and a historian of Independence Day. Through much of the 19th century, he says, it was a “loud, raucous time,” and the noise was considered a show of patriotism — whether by small boys with fire- crackers, miners with dynamite or towns with artillery firing salutes throughout the afternoon.
A major feature of the holiday dur- ing the 1800s would have been a patriotic speech by a leading citi- zen, sometimes lasting as long as two hours. “That was kind of the media event of that time,” Heintze explains.
Independence Day has also been used by Americans to express dissenting political views. In the years leading up to the American Civil War, leaders of the anti-slav- ery movement organized events — typically on July 5 — to remind people that, for African Americans, the Revolution’s promise of liberty had not been fulfilled. And from
the beginning of the Civil War, Americans in the South stopped celebrating July 4 out of loyalty to the Confederacy. July 4th cel- ebrations did not return to parts of the South for more than 35 years, Heintze says.
Today, most citizens celebrate in much the same ways as Americans did during the 18th century, with parades, picnics, neighborhood parties, outdoor concerts, sporting events and fireworks displays at night. Government offices and many businesses are closed, and workers typically have a paid holiday.
July 4 also remains a day for mak- ing a commitment to the country, as the signers of the Declaration did in 1776 when they pledged “our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor” to securing American inde- pendence. In many cities and at many historic sites, thousands of immigrants take an oath of alle- giance and become U.S. citizens on Independence Day.

Early Proponents:

One of the very proponents of an American Indian Day was Dr. Arthur C. Parker, a Seneca Indian, who was the director of the Museum of Arts and Science in Rochester, N.Y. He persuaded the Boy Scouts of America to set aside a day for the “First Americans” and for three years they adopted such a day. In 1915, the annual Congress of the American Indian Association meeting in Lawrence, Kans., formally approved a plan concerning American Indian Day. It directed its president, Rev. Sherman Coolidge, an Arapahoe, to call upon the country to observe such a day. Coolidge issued a proclamation on Sept. 28, 1915, which declared the second Saturday of each May as an American Indian Day and contained the first formal appeal for recognition of Indians as citizens.

The year before this proclamation was issued, Red Fox James, a Blackfoot Indian, rode horseback from state to state seeking approval for a day to honor Indians. On December 14, 1915, he presented the endorsements of 24 state governments at the White House. There is no record, however, of such a national day being proclaimed.

State Celebrations:

The first American Indian Day in a state was declared on the second Saturday in May 1916 by New York Governor Charles S. Whitman. Several states celebrate the fourth Friday in September. In Illinois, for example, legislators enacted such a day in 1919. Presently, several states have designated Columbus Day as Native American Day, but it continues to be a day we observe without any recognition as a national legal holiday.

Heritage Months:

In 1990 President George H. W. Bush approved a joint resolution designating November 1990 “National American Indian Heritage Month.” Similar proclamations have been issued each year since 1994.

World AIDS Day, observed December 1 each year, is dedicated to raising awareness of the AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV infection. AIDS has killed more than 25 million people, with an estimated 38.6 million people living with HIV, making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.

The concept of a World AIDS Day originated at the 1988 World Summit of Ministers of Health on Programmes for AIDS Prevention. Since then, it has been taken up by governments, international organizations and charities around the world.

From its inception until 2004, UNAIDS spearheaded the World AIDS Day campaign, choosing annual themes in consultation with other global health organizations. In 2005 this responsibility was turned over to World AIDS Campaign (WAC).

It is common to hold memorials to honor persons who have died from HIV/AIDS on this day. Government and health officials also observe, often with speeches or forums on the AIDS topics. Since 1995 the President of the United States has made an official proclamation on World AIDS Day."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Human Rights Day marks the U.N. General Assembly’s adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948.

On Human Rights Day, which was established in 1950, the United States and the international community celebrate the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the declaration and honor those who work to promote and protect those rights.

The United States is a supporter of human rights worldwide, and throughout the year produces documents including the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, which highlight successes and failures in the protection of the rights outlined in the declaration.

Today, human rights are recognized almost universally as fundamental freedoms that should be guaranteed to all people. Most nations now are committed to uphold and protect human rights, but this was not the case before the ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was the first international document to address in detail the notion that there exists a set of universal rights and fundamental freedoms that governments are obligated to secure for their citizens.

The declaration describes justice, equality and dignity as basic human rights of every man, woman and child. According to the declaration, “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights” and protecting the “inherent dignity of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.” The declaration became the foundation of international human-rights law.

After World War II, the international community recognized the need for an established statement of human rights. However, the drafters needed to create a document that would be approved by the then 58 member states, which had different political, ideological, religious and economic concerns.

The eight members of the declaration’s drafting committee – including U.S. first lady Eleanor Roosevelt representing the United States, and delegates from Australia, Chile, China, France, Lebanon, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom – all agreed that the idea of universal rights and freedoms must be codified.  After two years of debate and drafting, the declaration included the right to life, liberty and security of person; the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, thought, conscience; and the right to be free from torture.

Despite some disagreement among member states as to the scope of the document, the declaration also held that these rights were inherent to all of humanity, regardless of race, sex or religion.

“We stand today at the threshold of a great event both in the life of the United Nations and in the life of mankind,” said Eleanor Roosevelt as the declaration was presented to the U.N. General Assembly for a vote. “This declaration may well become the international Magna Carta for all men everywhere.”

The General Assembly voted to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948.

The declaration, although not legally binding, is now regarded as a customary law, that is, one whose principles are supported by the international community as practices that are required by law.

The declaration has inspired more than 60 human-rights documents, including legally binding treaties such as the 1976 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which protects the civil and political rights of individuals and nations, including the right to life and liberty and the right to self-determination. More than 150 states, including the United States, are parties to the covenant.

In addition, the principles outlined in the declaration have been enshrined in the constitutions of up to 90 countries, and the declaration has been translated into 300 languages.

The United States, on Human Rights Day and throughout the year, supports human rights in each region of the world."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"The Fourth of July—also known as Independence Day or July 4th—has been a federal holiday in the United States since 1941, but the tradition of Independence Day celebrations goes back to the 18th century and the American Revolution. On July 2nd, 1776, the Continental Congress voted in favor of independence, and two days later delegates from the 13 colonies adopted the Declaration of Independence, a historic document drafted by Thomas Jefferson. From 1776 to the present day, July 4th has been celebrated as the birth of American independence, with festivities ranging from fireworks, parades and concerts to more casual family gatherings and barbecues.

,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"A History of Independence Day

When the initial battles in the Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775, few colonists desired complete independence from Great Britain, and those who did were considered radical.

By the middle of the following year, however, many more colonists had come to favor independence, thanks to growing hostility against Britain and the spread of revolutionary sentiments such as those expressed in the bestselling pamphlet “Common Sense,” published by Thomas Paine in early 1776.

On June 7, when the Continental Congress met at the Pennsylvania State House (later Independence Hall) in Philadelphia, the Virginia delegate Richard Henry Lee introduced a motion calling for the colonies’ independence.

Amid heated debate, Congress postponed the vote on Lee’s resolution, but appointed a five-man committee—including Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, John Adams of Massachusetts, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania and Robert R. Livingston of New York—to draft a formal statement justifying the break with Great Britain.

Did you know? John Adams believed that July 2nd was the correct date on which to celebrate the birth of American independence, and would reportedly turn down invitations to appear at July 4th events in protest. Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died on July 4, 1826—the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence.

On July 2nd, the Continental Congress voted in favor of Lee’s resolution for independence in a near-unanimous vote (the New York delegation abstained, but later voted affirmatively). On that day, John Adams wrote to his wife Abigail that July 2 “will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival” and that the celebration should include “Pomp and Parade…Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other.”

On July 4th, the Continental Congress formally adopted the Declaration of Independence, which had been written largely by Jefferson. Though the vote for actual independence took place on July 2nd, from then on the 4th became the day that was celebrated as the birth of American independence.


Early Fourth of July Celebrations

In the pre-Revolutionary years, colonists had held annual celebrations of the king’s birthday, which traditionally included the ringing of bells, bonfires, processions and speechmaking. By contrast, during the summer of 1776 some colonists celebrated the birth of independence by holding mock funerals for King George III as a way of symbolizing the end of the monarchy’s hold on America and the triumph of liberty.

Festivities including concerts, bonfires, parades and the firing of cannons and muskets usually accompanied the first public readings of the Declaration of Independence, beginning immediately after its adoption. Philadelphia held the first annual commemoration of independence on July 4, 1777, while Congress was still occupied with the ongoing war.

George Washington issued double rations of rum to all his soldiers to mark the anniversary of independence in 1778, and in 1781, several months before the key American victory at the Battle of Yorktown, Massachusetts became the first state to make July 4th an official state holiday.

After the Revolutionary War, Americans continued to commemorate Independence Day every year, in celebrations that allowed the new nation’s emerging political leaders to address citizens and create a feeling of unity. By the last decade of the 18th century, the two major political parties—the Federalist Party and Democratic-Republicans—that had arisen began holding separate Fourth of July celebrations in many large cities.

Fourth of July Fireworks

The first fireworks were used as early as 200 BC. The tradition of setting off fireworks on the 4 of July began in Philadelphia on July 4, 1777, during the first organized celebration of Independence Day. Ship’s cannon fired a 13-gun salute in honor of the 13 colonies. The Pennsylvania Evening Post reported: “at night there was a grand exhibition of fireworks (which began and concluded with thirteen rockets) on the Commons, and the city was beautifully illuminated.” That same night, the Sons of Liberty set off fireworks over Boston Common."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Fourth of July Becomes a Federal Holiday

The tradition of patriotic celebration became even more widespread after the War of 1812, in which the United States again faced Great Britain. In 1870, the U.S. Congress made July 4th a federal holiday; in 1941, the provision was expanded to grant a paid holiday to all federal employees.

Over the years, the political importance of the holiday would decline, but Independence Day remained an important national holiday and a symbol of patriotism.

Falling in mid-summer, the Fourth of July has since the late 19th century become a major focus of leisure activities and a common occasion for family get-togethers, often involving fireworks and outdoor barbecues. The most common symbol of the holiday is the American flag, and a common musical accompaniment is “The Star-Spangled Banner,” the national anthem of the United States.

,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"The nation’s first Father’s Day was celebrated on June 19, 1910, in the state of Washington. However, it was not until 1972—58 years after President Woodrow Wilson made Mother’s Day official—that the day honoring fathers became a nationwide holiday in the United States. Father’s Day 2021 will occur on Sunday, June 20.

Mother’s Day: Inspiration for Father’s Day

The “Mother’s Day” we celebrate today has its origins in the peace-and-reconciliation campaigns of the post-Civil War era. During the 1860s, at the urging of activist Ann Reeves Jarvis, one divided West Virginia town celebrated “Mother’s Work Days” that brought together the mothers of Confederate and Union soldiers.

Did you know? There are more than 70 million fathers in the United States.
However, Mother’s Day did not become a commercial holiday until 1908, when–inspired by Jarvis’s daughter, Anna Jarvis, who wanted to honor her own mother by making Mother’s Day a national holiday–the John Wanamaker department store in Philadelphia sponsored a service dedicated to mothers in its auditorium.

Thanks in large part to this association with retailers, who saw great potential for profit in the holiday, Mother’s Day caught on right away. In 1909, 45 states observed the day, and in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson approved a resolution that made the second Sunday in May a holiday in honor of “that tender, gentle army, the mothers of America.”

Origins of Father’s Day

The campaign to celebrate the nation’s fathers did not meet with the same enthusiasm–perhaps because, as one florist explained, “fathers haven’t the same sentimental appeal that mothers have.”


On July 5, 1908, a West Virginia church sponsored the nation’s first event explicitly in honor of fathers, a Sunday sermon in memory of the 362 men who had died in the previous December’s explosions at the Fairmont Coal Company mines in Monongah, but it was a one-time commemoration and not an annual holiday.

The next year, a Spokane, Washington, woman named Sonora Smart Dodd, one of six children raised by a widower, tried to establish an official equivalent to Mother’s Day for male parents. She went to local churches, the YMCA, shopkeepers and government officials to drum up support for her idea, and she was successful: Washington State celebrated the nation’s first statewide Father’s Day on June 19, 1910.

Slowly, the holiday spread. In 1916, President Wilson honored the day by using telegraph signals to unfurl a flag in Spokane when he pressed a button in Washington, D.C. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge urged state governments to observe Father’s Day.

Today, the day honoring fathers is celebrated in the United States on the third Sunday of June: Father’s Day 2021 occurs on June 20.

In other countries–especially in Europe and Latin America–fathers are honored on St. Joseph’s Day, a traditional Catholic holiday that falls on March 19.

Father’s Day: Controversy and Commercialism

Many men, however, continued to disdain the day. As one historian writes, they “scoffed at the holiday’s sentimental attempts to domesticate manliness with flowers and gift-giving, or they derided the proliferation of such holidays as a commercial gimmick to sell more products–often paid for by the father himself.”

During the 1920s and 1930s, a movement arose to scrap Mother’s Day and Father’s Day altogether in favor of a single holiday, Parents’ Day. Every year on Mother’s Day, pro-Parents’ Day groups rallied in New York City’s Central Park–a public reminder, said Parents’ Day activist and radio performer Robert Spere, “that both parents should be loved and respected together.”

Paradoxically, however, the Great Depression derailed this effort to combine and de-commercialize the holidays. Struggling retailers and advertisers redoubled their efforts to make Father’s Day a “second Christmas” for men, promoting goods such as neckties, hats, socks, pipes and tobacco, golf clubs and other sporting goods, and greeting cards.

When World War II began, advertisers began to argue that celebrating Father’s Day was a way to honor American troops and support the war effort. By the end of the war, Father’s Day may not have been a federal holiday, but it was a national institution.

In 1972, in the middle of a hard-fought presidential re-election campaign, Richard Nixon signed a proclamation making Father’s Day a federal holiday at last. Today, economists estimate that Americans spend more than $1 billion each year on Father’s Day gifts."

Early Observances of Memorial Day

The Civil War, which ended in the spring of 1865, claimed more lives than any conflict in U.S. history and required the establishment of the country’s first national cemeteries.

By the late 1860s, Americans in various towns and cities had begun holding springtime tributes to these countless fallen soldiers, decorating their graves with flowers and reciting prayers.

Did you know? Each year on Memorial Day a national moment of remembrance takes place at 3:00 p.m. local time.
It is unclear where exactly this tradition originated; numerous different communities may have independently initiated the memorial gatherings. And some records show that one of the earliest Memorial Day commemorations was organized by a group of formerly enslaved people in Charleston, South Carolina less than a month after the Confederacy surrendered in 1865. Nevertheless, in 1966 the federal government declared Waterloo, New York, the official birthplace of Memorial Day.

Waterloo—which first celebrated the day on May 5, 1866—was chosen because it hosted an annual, community-wide event, during which businesses closed and residents decorated the graves of soldiers with flowers and flags.

Decoration Day

On May 5, 1868, General John A. Logan, leader of an organization for Northern Civil War veterans, called for a nationwide day of remembrance later that month. “The 30th of May, 1868, is designated for the purpose of strewing with flowers, or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion, and whose bodies now lie in almost every city, village and hamlet churchyard in the land,” he proclaimed.

The date of Decoration Day, as he called it, was chosen because it wasn’t the anniversary of any particular battle.

On the first Decoration Day, General James Garfield made a speech at Arlington National Cemetery, and 5,000 participants decorated the graves of the 20,000 Civil War soldiers buried there.

Many Northern states held similar commemorative events and reprised the tradition in subsequent years; by 1890 each one had made Decoration Day an official state holiday. Southern states, on the other hand, continued to honor the dead on separate days until after World War I.

History of Memorial Day

Memorial Day, as Decoration Day gradually came to be known, originally honored only those lost while fighting in the Civil War. But during World War I the United States found itself embroiled in another major conflict, and the holiday evolved to commemorate American military personnel who died in all wars, including World War II, The Vietnam War, The Korean War and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

For decades, Memorial Day continued to be observed on May 30, the date General Logan had selected for the first Decoration Day. But in 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which established Memorial Day as the last Monday in May in order to create a three-day weekend for federal employees. The change went into effect in 1971. The same law also declared Memorial Day a federal holiday.

Cities and towns across the United States host Memorial Day parades each year, often incorporating military personnel and members of veterans’ organizations. Some of the largest parades take place in Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C.

Americans also observe Memorial Day by visiting cemeteries and memorials. Some people wear a red poppy in remembrance of those fallen in war—a tradition that began with a World War I poem. On a less somber note, many people take weekend trips or throw parties and barbecues on the holiday, perhaps because Memorial Day weekend—the long weekend comprising the Saturday and Sunday before Memorial Day and Memorial Day itself—unofficially marks the beginning of summer."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Mother’s Day is a holiday honoring motherhood that is observed in different forms throughout the world. In the United States, Mother’s Day 2021 will occur on Sunday, May 9. The American incarnation of Mother’s Day was created by Anna Jarvis in 1908 and became an official U.S. holiday in 1914. Jarvis would later denounce the holiday’s commercialization and spent the latter part of her life trying to remove it from the calendar. While dates and celebrations vary, Mother’s Day traditionally involves presenting moms with flowers, cards and other gifts.

History of Mother’s Day

Celebrations of mothers and motherhood can be traced back to the ancient Greeks and Romans, who held festivals in honor of the mother goddesses Rhea and Cybele, but the clearest modern precedent for Mother’s Day is the early Christian festival known as “Mothering Sunday.”

Once a major tradition in the United Kingdom and parts of Europe, this celebration fell on the fourth Sunday in Lent and was originally seen as a time when the faithful would return to their “mother church”—the main church in the vicinity of their home—for a special service. 

Over time the Mothering Sunday tradition shifted into a more secular holiday, and children would present their mothers with flowers and other tokens of appreciation. This custom eventually faded in popularity before merging with the American Mother’s Day in the 1930s and 1940s.


Did you know? More phone calls are made on Mother’s Day than any other day of the year. These holiday chats with Mom often cause phone traffic to spike by as much as 37 percent.
Ann Reeves Jarvis and Julia Ward Howe

The origins of Mother’s Day as celebrated in the United States date back to the 19th century. In the years before the Civil War, Ann Reeves Jarvis of West Virginia helped start “Mothers’ Day Work Clubs” to teach local women how to properly care for their children.

These clubs later became a unifying force in a region of the country still divided over the Civil War. In 1868 Jarvis organized “Mothers’ Friendship Day,” at which mothers gathered with former Union and Confederate soldiers to promote reconciliation.

Another precursor to Mother’s Day came from the abolitionist and suffragette Julia Ward Howe. In 1870 Howe wrote the “Mother’s Day Proclamation,” a call to action that asked mothers to unite in promoting world peace. In 1873 Howe campaigned for a “Mother’s Peace Day” to be celebrated every June 2.

Other early Mother’s Day pioneers include Juliet Calhoun Blakely, a temperance activist who inspired a local Mother’s Day in Albion, Michigan, in the 1870s. The duo of Mary Towles Sasseen and Frank Hering, meanwhile, both worked to organize a Mothers’ Day in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some have even called Hering “the father of Mothers’ Day.”

Anna Jarvis Turns Mother's Day Into a National Holiday

The official Mother’s Day holiday arose in the 1900s as a result of the efforts of Anna Jarvis, daughter of Ann Reeves Jarvis. Following her mother’s 1905 death, Anna Jarvis conceived of Mother’s Day as a way of honoring the sacrifices mothers made for their children.


After gaining financial backing from a Philadelphia department store owner named John Wanamaker, in May 1908 she organized the first official Mother’s Day celebration at a Methodist church in Grafton, West Virginia. That same day also saw thousands of people attend a Mother’s Day event at one of Wanamaker’s retail stores in Philadelphia.

Following the success of her first Mother’s Day, Jarvis—who remained unmarried and childless her whole life—resolved to see her holiday added to the national calendar. Arguing that American holidays were biased toward male achievements, she started a massive letter writing campaign to newspapers and prominent politicians urging the adoption of a special day honoring motherhood.

By 1912 many states, towns and churches had adopted Mother’s Day as an annual holiday, and Jarvis had established the Mother’s Day International Association to help promote her cause. Her persistence paid off in 1914 when President Woodrow Wilson signed a measure officially establishing the second Sunday in May as Mother’s Day.

Jarvis Decries Commercialized Mother’s Day

Anna Jarvis had originally conceived of Mother’s Day as a day of personal celebration between mothers and families. Her version of the day involved wearing a white carnation as a badge and visiting one’s mother or attending church services. But once Mother’s Day became a national holiday, it was not long before florists, card companies and other merchants capitalized on its popularity.

While Jarvis had initially worked with the floral industry to help raise Mother’s Day’s profile, by 1920 she had become disgusted with how the holiday had been commercialized. She outwardly denounced the transformation and urged people to stop buying Mother’s Day flowers, cards and candies.

Jarvis eventually resorted to an open campaign against Mother’s Day profiteers, speaking out against confectioners, florists and even charities. She also launched countless lawsuits against groups that had used the name “Mother’s Day,” eventually spending most of her personal wealth in legal fees. By the time of her death in 1948 Jarvis had disowned the holiday altogether, and even actively lobbied the government to see it removed from the American calendar.

Mother’s Day Around the World

While versions of Mother’s Day are celebrated worldwide, traditions vary depending on the country. In Thailand, for example, Mother’s Day is always celebrated in August on the birthday of the current queen, Sirikit.

Another alternate observance of Mother’s Day can be found in Ethiopia, where families gather each fall to sing songs and eat a large feast as part of Antrosht, a multi-day celebration honoring motherhood.

In the United States, Mother’s Day continues to be celebrated by presenting mothers and other women with gifts and flowers, and it has become one of the biggest holidays for consumer spending. Families also celebrate by giving mothers a day off from activities like cooking or other household chores.

At times, Mother’s Day has also been a date for launching political or feminist causes. In 1968 Coretta Scott King, wife of Martin Luther King, Jr., used Mother’s Day to host a march in support of underprivileged women and children. In the 1970s women’s groups also used the holiday as a time to highlight the need for equal rights and access to childcare.

Throughout the years, there have been many different events and festivities worldwide, most with the express purpose of welcoming in a change of season (spring in the Northern Hemisphere). In the 19th century, May Day took on a new meaning, as an International Workers’ Day grew out of the 19th-century labor movement for worker’s rights and an eight-hour workday in the United States. May Day 2021 will be celebrated on Saturday, May 1, 2021.

Origins of May Day: Beltane

The Celts of the British Isles believed May 1 to be the most important day of the year, when the festival of Beltane was held.

This May Day festival was thought to divide the year in half, between the light and the dark. Symbolic fire was one of the main rituals of the festival, helping to celebrate the return of life and fertility to the world.

When the Romans took over the British Isles, they brought with them their five-day celebration known as Floralia, devoted to the worship of the goddess of flowers, Flora. Taking place between April 20 and May 2, the rituals of this celebration were eventually combined with Beltane.

May Day Maypole Dance

Another popular tradition of May Day involves the maypole. While the exact origins of the maypole remain unknown, the annual traditions surrounding it can be traced back to medieval times, and some are still celebrated today.

Villagers would enter the woods to find a maypole that was set up for the day in small towns (or sometimes permanently in larger cities). The day’s festivities involved merriment, as people would dance around the pole clad with colorful streamers and ribbons.

Historians believe the first maypole dance originated as part of a fertility ritual, where the pole symbolized male fertility and baskets and wreaths symbolized female fertility.

The maypole never really took root in America, where May Day celebrations were discouraged by the Puritans. But other forms of celebrations did find their way to the New World.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, May Basket Day was celebrated across the country, where baskets were created with flowers, candies and other treats and hung on the doors of friends, neighbors and loved ones on May 1.

What does May Day have to do with the international distress call, ""Mayday, Mayday, Mayday""? Nothing, as it turns out. The code was invented in 1923 by an airport radio officer in London. Challenged to come up with a word that would be easily understood by pilots and ground staff in case of an emergency, Frederick Mockford coined the word ""mayday"" because it sounded like ""m'aider,"" a shortened version of the French term for "" come and help me.""
International Workers’ Day

The connection between May Day and labor rights began in the United States. During the 19th century, at the height of the Industrial Revolution, thousands of men, women and children were dying every year from poor working conditions and long hours.

In an attempt to end these inhumane conditions, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (which would later become the American Federation of Labor, or AFL) held a convention in Chicago in 1884. The FOTLU proclaimed “eight hours shall constitute a legal day’s labor from and after May 1, 1886.”

The following year the Knights of Labor—then America’s largest labor organization—backed the proclamation as both groups encouraged workers to strike and demonstrate.

On May 1, 1886, more than 300,000 workers (40,000 in Chicago alone) from 13,000 business walked out of their jobs across the country. In the following days, more workers joined and the number of strikers grew to almost 100,000."

In 1918, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, an armistice, or temporary cessation of hostilities, was declared between the Allied nations and Germany in World War I, then known as “the Great War.” 

Commemorated in many countries as Armistice Day the following year, November 11th became a federal holiday in the United States in 1938. In the aftermath of World War II and the Korean War, Armistice Day became known as Veterans Day.

Armistice Day

The Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28, 1919, marking the official end of World War I. Nonetheless, the armistice date of November 11, 1918, remained in the public imagination as the date that marked the end of the conflict.

One year later, in November 1919, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed November 11 as the first commemoration of Armistice Day. The day’s observation included parades and public gatherings, as well as a brief pause in business and school activities at 11 a.m.

On November 11, 1921, an unidentified American soldier killed in the war was buried at Arlington National Cemetery near Washington, D.C. On the same day the previous year, unidentified soldiers were laid to rest at Westminster Abbey in London and at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

Did you know? Red poppies, a symbol of World War I from their appearance in the beloved poem ""In Flanders Fields"" by John McCrae, are sold in Canada and the United Kingdom on Remembrance Day to raise money for veterans or worn in the lapel as a tribute.
On June 4, 1926, Congress passed a resolution that the “recurring anniversary of [November 11, 1918] should be commemorated with thanksgiving and prayer and exercises designed to perpetuate peace through good will and mutual understanding between nations,” and that the president should issue an annual proclamation calling for the observance of Armistice Day.
By that time, 27 state legislatures had made November 11 a legal holiday. An act approved May 13, 1938 made November 11 a legal Federal holiday, “dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be hereafter celebrated and known as ‘Armistice Day.'”
In actuality, there are no U.S. national holidays because the states retain the right to designate their own, and the government can only designate holidays for federal employees and for the District of Columbia. In practice, however, states almost always follow the federal lead.
From Armistice Day to Veterans Day
American effort during World War II saw the greatest mobilization of the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force in the nation’s history (more than 16 million people); some 5.7 million more served in the Korean War.
In 1954, after lobbying efforts by veterans’ service organizations, the 83rd U.S. Congress amended the 1938 act that had made Armistice Day a holiday, striking the word “Armistice” in favor of “Veterans.” President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the legislation on June 1, 1954. From then on, November 11 became a day to honor American veterans of all wars.

The next development in the story of Veterans Day unfolded in 1968, when Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which sought to ensure three-day weekends for federal employees—and encourage tourism and travel—by celebrating four national holidays (Washington’s Birthday, Memorial Day, Veterans Day and Columbus Day) on Mondays.

The observation of Veterans Day was set as the fourth Monday in October. The first Veterans Day under the new law was Monday, October 25, 1971; confusion ensued, as many states disapproved of this change, and continued to observe the holiday on its original date.

In 1975, after it became evident that the actual date of Veterans Day carried historical and patriotic significance to many Americans, President Gerald Ford signed a new law returning the observation of Veterans Day to November 11th beginning in 1978. If November 11 falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the federal government observes the holiday on the previous Friday or following Monday, respectively. Government offices are closed on Veterans Day.

Remembrance Day

Great Britain, France, Australia and Canada also commemorate the veterans of World War I and II on or near November 11th: Canada has Remembrance Day, while Britain has Remembrance Sunday (the second Sunday of November). In Europe, Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries it is common to observe two minutes of silence at 11 a.m. every November 11.

In the United States, an official wreath-laying ceremony is held each Veterans Day at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery, while parades and other celebrations are held in states around the country.

Veterans Day is not to be confused with Memorial Day—a common misunderstanding, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Memorial Day (the fourth Monday in May) honors American service members who died in service to their country or as a result of injuries incurred during battle, while Veterans Day pays tribute to all American veterans—living or dead—but especially gives thanks to living veterans who served their country honorably during war or peacetime."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, is one of Judaism’s holiest days. Meaning “head of the year” or “first of the year,” the festival begins on the first day of Tishrei, the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar, which falls during September or October. Rosh Hashanah commemorates the creation of the world and marks the beginning of the Days of Awe, a 10-day period of introspection and repentance that culminates in the Yom Kippur holiday, also known as the Day of Atonement. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are the two “High Holy Days” in the Jewish religion.

When is Rosh Hashanah?

Rosh Hashanah 2021 begins on Monday, September 6, 2021 and ends on the evening of Wednesday, September 8, 2021. The exact date of Rosh Hashanah varies every year, since it is based on the Hebrew Calendar, where it begins on the first day of the seventh month. Rosh Hashanah is almost always in September or October. 

History and Significance of Rosh Hashanah


Rosh Hashanah is not mentioned in the Torah, Judaism’s founding religious text, and appears under different names in the Bible. Though the holiday was likely well established by the sixth century B.C., the phrase “Rosh Hashanah” shows up for the first time in the Mishna, a Jewish code of law compiled in 200 A.D.

Did you know? The ancient Jewish instrument known as the shofar, which is traditionally made from a ram's horn, has been used in classical and contemporary music, including composer Jerry Goldsmith's score for the 1979 film ""Alien.""
The Hebrew calendar begins with the month of Nisan, but Rosh Hashanah occurs at the start of Tishrei, when God is said to have created the world. For this reason, Rosh Hashanah can be seen as the birthday of the world rather than New Year’s in the secular sense; still, it is on Rosh Hashanah that the number of the civil year increases. The Mishna described three other “new years” in the Jewish calendar in addition to Rosh Hashanah. Nisan 1 was used to resume the cycle of months and measure the duration of kings’ reigns. Elul 1 resembled the start of the modern fiscal year and determined the tithing of animals for charity or sacrifice. Shevat 15 calculated the age of fruit-bearing trees and is now celebrated as the minor holiday of Tu B’Shevat.

According to tradition, God judges all creatures during the 10 Days of Awe between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, deciding whether they will live or die in the coming year. Jewish law teaches that God inscribes the names of the righteous in the “book of life” and condemns the wicked to death on Rosh Hashanah; people who fall between the two categories have until Yom Kippur to perform “teshuvah,” or repentance. As a result, observant Jews consider Rosh Hashanah and the days surrounding it a time for prayer, good deeds, reflecting on past mistakes and making amends with others.


Celebrating Rosh Hashanah


Unlike modern New Year’s celebrations, which are often raucous parties, Rosh Hashanah is a subdued and contemplative holiday. Because Jewish texts differ on the festival’s length, Rosh Hashanah is observed for a single day by some denominations and for two days by others. Work is prohibited, and religious Jews spend much of the holiday attending synagogue. Because the High Holy Day prayer services include distinct liturgical texts, songs and customs, rabbis and their congregations read from a special prayer book known as the machzor during both Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.

The sounding of the shofar—a trumpet made from a ram’s horn—is an essential and emblematic part of both Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. The ancient instrument’s plaintive cry serves as a call to repentance and a reminder to Jews that God is their king. Tradition requires the shofar blower to play four sets of notes on Rosh Hashanah: tekiah, a long blast; shevarim, three short blasts; teruah, nine staccato blasts; and tekiah gedolah, a very long blast. Because of this ritual’s close association with Rosh Hashanah, the holiday is also known as Yom Teruah—the day of the sounding of the shofar.

After religious services are over, many Jews return home for a festive meal steeped in symbolism and tradition. Some choose to wear new or special clothing and to adorn their tables with fine linens and place settings in recognition of Rosh Hashanah’s significance. The meal typically begins with the ceremonial lighting of two candles and features foods that represent positive wishes for the new year.

Customs and Symbols of Rosh Hashanah

Apples and honey: One of the most popular Rosh Hashanah customs involves eating apple slices dipped in honey, sometimes after saying a special prayer. Ancient Jews believed apples had healing properties, and the honey signifies the hope that the new year will be sweet. Rosh Hashanah meals usually include an assortment of sweet treats for the same reason.

Round challah: On Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath) and other holidays, Jews eat loaves of the traditional braided bread known as challah. On Rosh Hashanah, the challah is often baked in a round shape to symbolize either the cyclical nature of life or the crown of God. Raisins are sometimes added to the dough for a sweet new year.

Tashlich: On Rosh Hashanah, some Jews practice a custom known as tashlich (“casting off”), in which they throw pieces of bread into a flowing body of water while reciting prayers. As the bread, which symbolize the sins of the past year, is swept away, those who embrace this tradition are spiritually cleansed and renewed.

“L’shana tovah”: Jews greet each other on Rosh Hashanah with the Hebrew phrase “L’shana tovah,” which translates to “for a good year.” This is a shortened version of the Rosh Hashanah salutation “L’shanah tovah tikatev v’taihatem” (“May you be inscribed and sealed for a good year”)."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Presidents' Day is a federal holiday celebrated on the third Monday in February; Presidents' Day 2022 will occur on Monday, February 21. Originally established in 1885 in recognition of President George Washington, the holiday became popularly known as Presidents' Day after it was moved as part of 1971’s Uniform Monday Holiday Act, an attempt to create more three-day weekends for the nation’s workers. While several states still have individual holidays honoring the birthdays of Washington, Abraham Lincoln and other figures, Presidents' Day is now popularly viewed as a day to celebrate all U.S. presidents, past and present.

Washington's Birthday

The story of Presidents' Day date begins in 1800. Following the death of George Washington in 1799, his February 22 birthday became a perennial day of remembrance.

At the time, Washington was venerated as the most important figure in American history, and events like the 1832 centennial of his birth and the start of construction of the Washington Monument in 1848 were cause for national celebration.

Wshington_Timeline
While Washington’s Birthday was an unofficial observance for most of the 1800s, it was not until the late 1870s that it became a federal holiday. Senator Stephen Wallace Dorsey of Arkansas was the first to propose the measure, and in 1879 President Rutherford B. Hayes signed it into law.

The holiday initially only applied to the District of Columbia, but in 1885 it was expanded to the whole country. At the time, Washington’s Birthday joined four other nationally recognized federal bank holidays—Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving—and was the first to celebrate the life of an individual American. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, signed into law in 1983, was the second.

Uniform Monday Holiday Act

The shift from Washington’s Birthday to Presidents' Day began in the late 1960s, when Congress proposed a measure known as the Uniform Monday Holiday Act. Championed by Senator Robert McClory of Illinois, this law sought to shift the celebration of several federal holidays from specific dates to a series of predetermined Mondays.

The proposed change was seen by many as a novel way to create more three-day weekends for the nation’s workers, and it was believed that ensuring holidays always fell on the same weekday would reduce employee absenteeism. While some argued that shifting holidays from their original dates would cheapen their meaning, the bill also had widespread support from both the private sector and labor unions and was seen as a surefire way to bolster retail sales.

The Uniform Monday Holiday Act also included a provision to combine the celebration of Washington’s birthday with that of Abraham Lincoln, which fell on February 12. Lincoln’s Birthday had long been a state holiday in places like Illinois, and many supported joining the two days as a way of giving equal recognition to two of America’s most famous statesmen.

McClory was among the measure’s major proponents, and he even floated the idea of renaming the holiday Presidents' Day. This proved to be a point of contention for lawmakers from George Washington’s home state of Virginia, and the proposal was eventually dropped.

Nevertheless, the main piece of the Uniform Monday Holiday Act passed in 1968 and officially took effect in 1971 following an executive order from President Richard M. Nixon. Washington’s Birthday was then shifted from the fixed date of February 22 to the third Monday of February. Columbus Day, Memorial Day and Veterans Day were also moved from their traditionally designated dates. (As a result of widespread criticism, in 1978 Veterans Day was returned to its original November 11 date.)

Did you know? Presidents' Day never falls on the actual birthday of any American president. Four chief executives—George Washington, William Henry Harrison, Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan—were born in February, but their birthdays all come either too early or late to coincide with Presidents' Day, which is always celebrated on the third Monday of the month.

What Presidents Do We Celebrate on Presidents' Day?

While Nixon’s order plainly called the newly placed holiday Washington’s Birthday, it was not long before the shift to Presidents' Day began.

The move away from February 22 led many to believe that the new date was intended to honor both Washington and Lincoln, as it now fell between their two birthdays. Marketers soon jumped at the opportunity to play up the three-day weekend with sales, and “Presidents' Day” bargains were advertised at stores around the country.

By the mid-1980s, Washington’s Birthday was known to many Americans as Presidents' Day. This shift had solidified in the early 2000s, by which time as many as half the 50 states had changed the holiday’s name to Presidents' Day on their calendars.

Some states have even chosen to customize the holiday by adding new figures to the celebration. Arkansas, for instance, celebrates Washington as well as civil rights activist Daisy Gatson Bates. Alabama, meanwhile, uses Presidents' Day to commemorate Washington and Thomas Jefferson (who was born in April).

Washington and Lincoln still remain the two most recognized leaders, but Presidents' Day is now popularly seen as a day to recognize the lives and achievements of all of America’s chief executives. Some lawmakers have objected to this view, arguing that grouping George Washington and Abraham Lincoln together with less successful presidents minimizes their legacies.

Congressional measures to restore Washington and Lincoln’s individual birthdays were proposed during the early 2000s, but all failed to gain much attention. For its part, the federal government has held fast to the original incarnation of the holiday as a celebration of the country’s first president. The third Monday in February is still listed on official calendars as Washington’s Birthday."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Arbor Day—which literally translates to “tree” day from the Latin origin of the word arbor—is a holiday that celebrates the planting, upkeep and preservation of trees. For centuries, communities spanning the globe have found various ways to honor nature and the environment. However, the appreciation of trees and forests in modern times can be largely attributed to Arbor Day. And although Arbor Day may not have the same clout as holidays like Valentine’s Day or St. Patrick’s Day (or even Earth Day), it has a history with strong roots that branched out across multiple nations. Arbor Day 2021 will occur on Friday, April 30, and is typically celebrated on the last Friday in April in the United States.

What Is Arbor Day?

The origins of Arbor Day date back to the early 1870s in Nebraska City, . A journalist by the name of Julius Sterling Morton moved to the state with his wife, Caroline, in 1854, a little more than 10 years before Nebraska gained its statehood in 1867. The couple purchased 160 acres in Nebraska City and planted a wide variety of trees and shrubs in what was a primarily a flat stretch of desolate plain.

Morton also became the editor of the state’s first newspaper, Nebraska City News, which was a perfect platform for Morton to spread his knowledge of trees… and to stress their ecological importance to Nebraska. His message of tree life resonated with his readers, many of whom recognized the lack of forestation in their community. Morton also became involved with the Nebraska Board of Agriculture.


On January 7, 1872, Morton proposed a day that would encourage all Nebraskans to plant trees in their community. The agriculture board agreed, and after some back-and-forth about the title—the event was originally going to be called “Sylvan Day” in reference to forest trees—Morton convinced everyone that the day should reflect the appreciation of all trees, and “Arbor Day” was born.

The First Arbor Day

With the seeds of interest already planted in the minds of devoted Nebraska City News readers, the first ever Arbor Day was held on April 10, 1872 and was a wild success. Morton led the charge in the planting of approximately 1 million trees. Enthusiasm and engagement was aided by the prizes awarded to those who planted trees correctly.

The tradition quickly began to spread. In 1882, schools across the country started to participate, and more than a decade after its introduction, Arbor Day became an official state holiday in Nebraska in 1885. April 22 was initially chosen because of its ideal weather for planting trees and in recognition of Morton’s birthday.

Within 20 years, Arbor Day had reached a large swath of the nation and was celebrated in every state except for Delaware. The holiday spread even further with the help of fellow agriculturalist Birdsey Northrop. In 1883, Northrop introduced the concept of Arbor Day to Japan, and continued to influence the creation of Arbor Days across Europe, Canada and Australia.

Theodore Roosevelt and Arbor Day

On April 15, 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt, a supporter of the Conservation Movement, issued an ""Arbor Day Proclamation to the School Children of the United States,” telling them:


“It is well that you should celebrate your Arbor Day thoughtfully, for within your lifetimes the Nation’s need of trees will become serious. We of an older generation can get along with what we have, though with growing hardship; but in your full manhood and womanhood you will want what nature once so bountifully supplied and man so thoughtlessly destroyed.”

Arbor Day Becomes A National Holiday

It wasn’t until 1970, however, that Arbor Day became recognized nationwide thanks to the efforts of President Richard Nixon. This move was in line with other environmentally-friendly actions taken by Nixon in the 1970s, including the passing of the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Protection Act, along with the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.

Although some states celebrate Arbor Day at different times of year to ensure that the trees are in the best environment to thrive, the national observance falls on the last Friday in April. And although Julius Morton died in 1902, well before the holiday was given a formal day of observance across the country, he is still commemorated in Washington, D.C. in a statue dedicated to the “Father of Arbor Day” in the National Hall of Fame.

How Do You Celebrate Arbor Day?

Arbor Day is celebrated on the last Friday in April in the United States. It is marked by the planting of trees and emphasizes caring for them as a way to sustainably protect our planet’s natural resources. People often dedicate trees to loved ones. Morton’s words about Arbor Day resonate strongly today, as climate change becomes a growing threat: “Other holidays repose upon the past; Arbor Day proposes for the future.”

,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Earth Day was founded in 1970 as a day of education about environmental issues, and Earth Day 2021 will occur on Thursday, April 22—the holiday's 51st anniversary. The holiday is now a global celebration that’s sometimes extended into Earth Week, a full seven days of events focused on green living. The brainchild of Senator Gaylord Nelson and inspired by the protests of the 1960s, Earth Day began as a “national teach-in on the environment” and was held on April 22 to maximize the number of students that could be reached on university campuses. By raising public awareness of pollution, Nelson hoped to bring environmental causes into the national spotlight.

Earth Day History

By the early 1960s, Americans were becoming aware of the effects of pollution on the environment. Rachel Carson’s 1962 bestseller Silent Spring raised the specter of the dangerous effects of pesticides on the American countryside. Later in the decade, a 1969 fire on Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River shed light on the problem of chemical waste disposal. Until that time, protecting the planet’s natural resources was not part of the national political agenda, and the number of activists devoted to large-scale issues such as industrial pollution was minimal. Factories pumped pollutants into the air, lakes and rivers with few legal consequences. Big, gas-guzzling cars were considered a sign of prosperity. Only a small portion of the American population was familiar with–let alone practiced–recycling.

Did you know? A highlight of the United Nations' Earth Day celebration in New York City is the ringing of the Peace Bell, a gift from Japan, at the exact moment of the vernal equinox.
Who Started Earth Day?

Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1962, Senator Gaylord Nelson, a Democrat from Wisconsin, was determined to convince the federal government that the planet was at risk. In 1969, Nelson, considered one of the leaders of the modern environmental movement, developed the idea for Earth Day after being inspired by the anti-Vietnam War “teach-ins” that were taking place on college campuses around the United States. According to Nelson, he envisioned a large-scale, grassroots environmental demonstration “to shake up the political establishment and force this issue onto the national agenda.”

Nelson announced the Earth Day concept at a conference in Seattle in the fall of 1969 and invited the entire nation to get involved. He later recalled:

“The wire services carried the story from coast to coast. The response was electric. It took off like gangbusters. Telegrams, letters and telephone inquiries poured in from all across the country. The American people finally had a forum to express its concern about what was happening to the land, rivers, lakes and air—and they did so with spectacular exuberance.”

Denis Hayes, a young activist who had served as student president at Stanford University, was selected as Earth Day’s national coordinator, and he worked with an army of student volunteers and several staff members from Nelson’s Senate office to organize the project. According to Nelson, “Earth Day worked because of the spontaneous response at the grassroots level. We had neither the time nor resources to organize 20 million demonstrators and the thousands of schools and local communities that participated. That was the remarkable thing about Earth Day. It organized itself.”

On the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970, rallies were held in Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles and most other American cities, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In New York City, Mayor John Lindsay closed off a portion of Fifth Avenue to traffic for several hours and spoke at a rally in Union Square with actors Paul Newman and Ali McGraw. In Washington, D.C., thousands of people listened to speeches and performances by singer Pete Seeger and others, and Congress went into recess so its members could speak to their constituents at Earth Day events.

The first Earth Day was effective at raising awareness about environmental issues and transforming public attitudes. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, “Public opinion polls indicate that a permanent change in national priorities followed Earth Day 1970. When polled in May 1971, 25 percent of the U.S. public declared protecting the environment to be an important goal, a 2,500 percent increase over 1969.” Earth Day kicked off the “Environmental decade with a bang,” as Senator Nelson later put it. During the 1970s, a number of important pieces of environmental legislation were passed, among them the Clean Air Act, the Water Quality Improvement Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. Another key development was the establishment in December 1970 of the Environmental Protection Agency, which was tasked with protecting human health and safeguarding the natural environment—air, water and land.

Since 1970, Earth Day celebrations have grown. In 1990, Earth Day went global, with 200 million people in over 140 nations participating, according to the Earth Day Network (EDN), a nonprofit organization that coordinates Earth Day activities. In 2000, Earth Day focused on clean energy and involved hundreds of millions of people in 184 countries and 5,000 environmental groups, according to EDN. Activities ranged from a traveling, talking drum chain in Gabon, Africa, to a gathering of hundreds of thousands of people at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Today, the Earth Day Network collaborates with more than 17,000 partners and organizations in 174 countries. According to EDN, more than 1 billion people are involved in Earth Day activities, making it “the largest secular civic event in the world.”"
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Ramadan is a holy month of fasting, introspection and prayer for Muslims, the followers of Islam. It is celebrated as the month during which Muhammad received the initial revelations of the Quran, the holy book for Muslims. Fasting is one of the five fundamental principles of Islam. Each day during Ramadan, Muslims do not eat or drink from dawn to sunset. They are also supposed to avoid impure thoughts and bad behavior. Muslims break their daily fasts by sharing meals with family and friends, and the end of Ramadan is celebrated with a three-day festival known as Eid al-Fitr, one of Islam’s major holidays. Ramadan always falls on the ninth month of the 12-month Islamic calendar. Ramadan 2021 begins at sunset on Monday, April 12, and ends on Wednesday, May 12.

Facts About Islam 

Islam is the world’s second largest religion after Christianity and has more than 1 billion followers. Islam originated in Arabia and has spread all over the world.

Countries with the largest Muslim populations include Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt, Turkey and Iran. There are an estimated 7 million Muslims in America, along with Islamic places of worship, called mosques, in all 50 states.

Did you know? America's first mosque was built by Lebanese immigrants in North Dakota in the 1920s. The mosque was torn down in the 1970s and later replaced. What's believed to be the oldest surviving mosque in the U.S. was constructed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in the 1930s.
Muslims believe that around 610 A.D. a man named Muhammad (c.570-632) from the Arabian city of Mecca started receiving revelations from God, or Allah, via the angel Gabriel. The revelations were collected into a 114-chapter holy book known as the Quran (or Koran), which Muslims believe contains the exact words of God.

Muhammad is, according to Muslims, the final prophet in a line of prophets (including Adam, Abraham, Moses and Jesus) who were chosen by God to act as messengers and teach mankind. Muslims believe there is one all-knowing God, and people can achieve salvation by following his commandments. In Arabic, Islam means “submission” or “surrender” (to God).

A series of formal acts of worship, known as the Five Pillars of Islam, are fundamental to the lives of Muslims. The pillars include shahada (a declaration of faith: “There is no deity but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God”); prayer (Muslims pray five times a day); zakat (charitable giving); fasting and pilgrimage (Muslims are supposed to make a trip, or “hajj,” to the city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, at least once in a lifetime if they are physically and financially able).

When Is Ramadan?

Ramadan 2021 begins at sunset on Monday, April 12, and ends on Wednesday, May 12. The following year, Ramadan 2022 will begin at sunset on Saturday, April 2 and end on Sunday, May 1.

Ramadan is the ninth month of the 12-month Islamic calendar, a lunar calendar that’s based on the phases of the moon. The lunar calendar falls short of the solar calendar by 11 days.

As a result, Ramadan doesn’t start on the same date each year and instead, over time, passes through all the seasons

Why Is Ramadan Celebrated?

Ramadan is celebrated as the month during which Muhammad received the initial revelations of what became the Quran, the holy book for Muslims, from God.

The Quran states:

“The month of Ramadhan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur’an, guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it.”

The Rules of Ramadan

During Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to dusk each day. They are supposed to avoid eating, drinking, smoking and sexual activity, as well as unkind or impure thoughts and words and immoral behavior.

Ramadan is a time to practice self-restraint and self-reflection. Fasting is seen as a way to cleanse the soul and have empathy for those in the world who are hungry and less fortunate. Muslims go to work and school and take care of their usual activities during Ramadan; however, some also read the entire Quran, say special prayers and attend mosques more frequently during this time.

All Muslims who have reached puberty and are in good health are required to fast. The sick and elderly, along with travelers, pregnant women and those who are nursing are exempt, although they are supposed to make up for the missed fast days sometime in the future or help feed the poor.

The first pre-dawn meal of the day during Ramadan is called “suhoor.” Each day’s fast is broken with a meal known as “iftar.” Traditionally, a date is eaten to break the fast. Iftars are often elaborate feasts celebrated with family and friends. The types of foods served vary according to culture.

Eid al-Fitr

The conclusion of Ramadan is marked with a major celebration known as Eid al-Fitr (or Eid ul-Fitr), the Feast of Fast-Breaking. It starts the day after Ramadan ends and lasts for three days.

Eid al-Fitr includes special prayers and meals with friends and relatives, and gifts are often exchanged.

In 1996, then-first lady Hillary Clinton hosted the first Eid al-Fitr dinner at the White House. President Bill Clinton continued the tradition throughout the rest of his time in office.

His successor, President George W. Bush, hosted an iftar at the White House in 2001 and continued the dinners every year of his two terms in power. President Barack Obama followed suit, hosting his first White House Ramadan dinner in August 2010. After skipping it in 2017, President Donald Trump hosted iftar dinners to honor the Muslim holy month in 2018 and 2019."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament of the Bible, the event is said to have occurred three days after Jesus was crucified by the Romans and died in roughly 30 A.D. The holiday concludes the “Passion of Christ,” a series of events and holidays that begins with Lent—a 40-day period of fasting, prayer and sacrifice—and ends with Holy Week, which includes Holy Thursday (the celebration of Jesus’ Last Supper with his 12 Apostles, also known as “Maundy Thursday”), Good Friday (on which Jesus’ crucifixion is observed) and Easter Sunday. Although a holiday of high religious significance in the Christian faith, many traditions associated with Easter date back to pre-Christian, pagan times.
Easter 2021 occurs on Sunday, April 4. However, Easter falls on a different date each year.

Easter Sunday and related celebrations, such as Ash Wednesday and Palm Sunday, are considered “moveable feasts,” although, in western Christianity, which follows the Gregorian calendar, Easter always falls on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25. Easter typically falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon occurring on or after the spring equinox.

In Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which adheres to the Julian calendar, Easter falls on a Sunday between April 4 and May 8 each year.

In some denominations of Protestant Christianity, Easter Sunday marks the beginning of Eastertide, or the Easter Season. Eastertide ends on the 50th day after Easter, which is known as Pentecost Sunday.

In Eastern Orthodox branches of Christianity, Easter Sunday serves as the start of the season of Pascha (Greek for “Easter”), which ends 40 days later with the holiday known as the Feast of the Ascension.

Why Is Easter Called ‘Easter’?

St. Bede the Venerable, the 6 century author of Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (“Ecclesiastical History of the English People”), maintains that the English word ""Easter"" comes from Eostre, or Eostrae, the Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring and fertility. Other historians maintain the “Easter” derives from in albis, a Latin phrase that's pural for alba, or “dawn,"" that became eostarum in Old High German, a precursor to the English language of today.

Despite its significance as a Christian holy day, many of the traditions and symbols that play a key role in Easter observances actually have roots in pagan celebrations—particularly the pagan goddess Eostre—and in the Jewish holiday of Passover.

Religious Tradition of Easter

The resurrection of Jesus, as described in the New Testament of the Bible, is essentially the foundation upon which the Christian religions are built. Hence, Easter is a very significant date on the Christian calendar.

According to the New Testament, Jesus was arrested by the Roman authorities, essentially because he claimed to be the “Son of God,” although historians question this motive, with some saying that the Romans may have viewed him as a threat to the empire.

He was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect in the province of Judea from 26 to 36 A.D. Jesus’ death by crucifixion, marked by the Christian holiday Good Friday (the Friday before Easter), and subsequent resurrection three days later is said, by the authors of the gospels, to prove that he was the living son of God.

In varying ways, all four of the gospels in the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) state that those who believe in Jesus’ death and resurrection are given “the gift of eternal life,” meaning that those of faith will be welcomed into the “Kingdom of Heaven” upon their earthly death.

Notably, Easter is also associated with the Jewish holiday of Passover, as well as the exodus of the Jews from Egypt, as described in the Old Testament. These links are clearly seen in the Last Supper, which occurred the night before Jesus’ arrest and the sufferings Jesus endured following his arrest.

The Last Supper was essentially a Passover feast. However, the New Testament describes it as being given new significance by Jesus: He identified the matzah (or bread) he shared with his 12 apostles as his “body” and the cup of wine they drank as his “blood.”

These rituals would come to symbolize the sacrifice he was about to make in death, and became the basis for the Christian ritual of Holy Communion, which remains a fundamental part of Christian religious services.

As Jesus’ arrest and execution were said to have occurred during the Jewish observance of Passover, the Easter holiday is often close to the former celebration on the Judeo-Christian calendar.

Easter Traditions

In western Christianity, including Roman Catholicism and Protestant denominations, the period prior to Easter holds special significance.

This period of fasting and penitence is called Lent. It begins on Ash Wednesday, and lasts for 40 days (not including Sundays).

The Sunday immediately prior to Easter is called Palm Sunday, and it commemorates Jesus’ arrival in Jerusalem, when followers laid palm leaves across the road to greet him.

Many churches begin the Easter observance in the late hours of the day before (Holy Saturday) in a religious service called the Easter Vigil.

In Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Easter rituals start with the Great Lent, which begins on Clean Monday (40 days prior to Easter, not including Sundays). The last week of Great Lent is referred to as Palm Week, and it ends with Lazarus Saturday, the day before Palm Sunday.

Palm Sunday marks the beginning of Holy Week, which ends on Easter.

,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Chinese New Year is the most important holiday in China. In 2021, Chinese New Year will begin on February 12. Tied to the Chinese lunar calendar, the holiday was traditionally a time to honor household and heavenly deities as well as ancestors. It was also a time to bring family together for feasting. With the popular adoption of the Western calendar in 1912, the Chinese joined in celebrating January 1 as New Year’s Day. China, however, continues to celebrate Chinese New Year with the traditional greeting, “Kung hei fat choi.”

Lunar New Year

The ancient Chinese lunar calendar, on which Chinese New Year is based, functioned as a religious, dynastic and social guide. Oracle bones inscribed with astronomical records indicate that the calendar existed as early as 14th century B.C., when the Shang Dynasty was in power.

The calendar’s structure wasn’t static: It was reset according to which emperor held power and varied from one region to another.

The Chinese calendar was a complex timepiece. Its parameters were set according to the lunar phases as well as the solar solstices and equinoxes. Yin and yang, the opposing but complementary principles that make up a harmonious world, also ruled the calendar.

Chinese New Year typically begins with the new moon that occurs between the end of January and the end of February, and it lasts about 15 days, until the full moon arrives with the Festival of Lanterns.

Chinese New Year Animals

The Chinese calendar also included the Chinese zodiac, the cycle of twelve stations or “signs” along the apparent path of the sun through the cosmos.

Each new year was marked by the characteristics of one of the 12 zodiac animals: the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig.

Chinese New Year Traditions

The traditional Chinese New Year was the most important festival on the calendar. The entire attention of the household was fixed on the celebration. During this time, business life came nearly to a stop. Home and family were the principal focuses.

In preparation for the holiday, houses were thoroughly cleaned to rid them of “huiqi,” or inauspicious breaths, which might have collected during the old year. Cleaning was also meant to appease the gods who would be coming down from heaven to make inspections.

Ritual sacrifices of food and paper icons were offered to gods and ancestors. People posted scrolls printed with lucky messages on household gates and set off firecrackers to frighten evil spirits. Elders gave out money to children.

In fact, many of the rites carried out during this period were meant to bring good luck to the household and long life to the family—particularly to the parents.

Chinese New Year Food

Most important was the feasting: On New Year’s Eve, the extended family would join around the table for a meal that included as the last course a fish that was symbolic of abundance and therefore not meant to be eaten.

In the first five days of the New Year, people ate long noodles to symbolize long life. On the 15th and final day of the New Year, round dumplings shaped like the full moon were shared as a sign of the family unit and of perfection.

Spring Festival

The Western-style Gregorian calendar arrived in China along with Jesuit missionaries in 1582. It began to be used by the general population by 1912, and New Year’s Day was officially recognized as occurring on January 1.

Beginning in 1949, under the rule of Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong, the government forbade celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year and followed the Gregorian calendar in its dealings with the West.

But at the end of the 20th century, Chinese leaders were more willing to accept the Chinese tradition. In 1996, China instituted a weeklong vacation during the holiday—now called Spring Festival—giving people the opportunity to travel home and to celebrate the new year.

Did you know? San Francisco, California, claims its Chinese New Year parade is the biggest celebration of its kind outside of Asia. The city has hosted a Chinese New Year celebration since the Gold Rush era of the 1860s, a period of large-scale Chinese immigration to the region.
In the early 21st century, many Chinese families spent a significant amount of their discretionary income celebrating the Spring Festival with traditional symbols and food. They also spent time watching the televised Spring Festival Gala: an annual variety show featuring traditional and contemporary singers, dancers and magic demonstrations.

Although the rites of the holiday no longer had religious value, people remained sensitive to the zodiac animals to the extent that they considered what, for example, a Year of the Pig in 2019 might mean for their personal fortunes or for a child born at that time.

A change in attitude toward the Spring Festival has occurred in China’s young people, with Chinese college students reporting that they prefer surfing the Internet, sleeping, watching TV or spending time with friends over celebrating with family. They also reported not liking traditional New Year food such as dumplings and glutinous rice pastry.

With its change of name from Chinese New Year to Spring Festival, for some members of the younger generation the holiday has evolved from an opportunity to renew family ties to a chance for relaxation from work.

,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Chinese New Year celebrations were born out of fear and myth. Legend spoke of the wild beast Nian (which also is the word for “year”) that appeared at the end of each year, attacking and killing villagers. Loud noises and bright lights were used to scare the beast away, and the Chinese New Year celebrations were born. Today, the 15-day New Year festivities are celebrated with a week of vacation in metropolitan areas of China. Much like the Western New Year (January 1st), the biggest celebration is on the eve of the holiday. At the turn of the new year, firework displays are put on throughout the city.

Traditions

Aside from New Year’s Eve, there are other important days of the 15-day Chinese New Year Festival, including:

JIE CAI CENG: Welcoming the Gods of Wealth and Prosperity
On the fifth day of New Year’s, it is believed that the gods of prosperity come down from the heavens. Businesses will often participate in setting off firecrackers as they believe it will bring them prosperity and good fortune for their business.

YUAN XIAO JIE: Festival of Lanterns
The 15th day of the New Year is known as the Festival of Lanterns and marks the end of the Chinese New Year celebrations. All types of lanterns are lit throughout the streets and often poems and riddles are often written for entertainment.

There are also paper lanterns on wheels created in the form of either a rabbit or the animal of the year (Dog for 2018). The rabbit lantern stems from a Chinese myth or fairytale about a female goddess named Chang E who jumped onto the moon.

So she wouldn’t travel alone, she brought a rabbit with her to keep her company. It is said that if your heart is pure enough, you can see the goddess Chang E and her rabbit on the moon on this day.

Symbols

Red envelopes 
Called “hong bao” in Mandarin, the red envelopes filled with money are typically only given to children or unmarried adults with no job. If you’re single and working and making money, you still have to give the younger ones the hong bao money.

The color red denotes good luck/fortune and happiness/abundance in the Chinese Culture and is often worn or used for decoration in other celebrations.

Dragon 
The dragon is present in many Chinese cultural celebrations as the Chinese people often think of themselves as descendants of the mythical creature. On the fifth day of the New Year when many people have to start going back to work, they will also have dancing dragons perform in the front of the office building.

On the 15th day of the New Year (Yuan Xiao Jie), they may also have a lot of dancing dragon performances. The dragon represents prosperity, good luck and good fortune.

Traditional Foods

The Chinese New Year’s Eve meal is the most important dinner of the year. Typically, families gather at a designated relative’s house for dinner, but these days, many families often celebrate New Year’s Eve dinner at a restaurant. Many restaurants require reservations months in advance.

There are also some families that hire a professional chef to come cook at their house. Chefs are often busy running from one home to another cooking dinners for different families on New Year’s Eve.

Chinese New Year is a 15-day celebration and each day, many families rotate celebrations between homes of their relatives. The festivities are day-long and sometimes, a family ends up cooking two meals for their relatives, once at lunch and once at dinner.

These dishes used to be all made from scratch, but now people can easily buy them prepackaged at the supermarkets.

Eight Treasures Rice, which contains rice, walnuts, different colored dry fruit, raisins, sweet red bean paste, jujube dates, and almonds
“Tang Yuan” – black sesame rice ball soup; or a won ton soup
Chicken, duck, fish and pork dishes
“Song Gao,” literally translates to “loose cake,” which is made of rice which has been coarsely ground and then formed into a small, sweet round cake
“Jiu Niang Tang” – sweet wine-rice soup which contains small rice balls"
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Civilizations around the world have been celebrating the start of each new year for at least four millennia. Today, most New Year’s festivities begin on December 31 (New Year’s Eve), the last day of the Gregorian calendar, and continue into the early hours of January 1 (New Year’s Day). Common traditions include attending parties, eating special New Year’s foods, making resolutions for the new year and watching fireworks displays.

Ancient New Year’s Celebrations

The earliest recorded festivities in honor of a new year’s arrival date back some 4,000 years to ancient Babylon. For the Babylonians, the first new moon following the vernal equinox—the day in late March with an equal amount of sunlight and darkness—heralded the start of a new year. They marked the occasion with a massive religious festival called Akitu (derived from the Sumerian word for barley, which was cut in the spring) that involved a different ritual on each of its 11 days. In addition to the new year, Atiku celebrated the mythical victory of the Babylonian sky god Marduk over the evil sea goddess Tiamat and served an important political purpose: It was during this time that a new king was crowned or that the current ruler’s divine mandate was symbolically renewed.

Did you know? In order to realign the Roman calendar with the sun, Julius Caesar had to add 90 extra days to the year 46 B.C. when he introduced his new Julian calendar.
Throughout antiquity, civilizations around the world developed increasingly sophisticated calendars, typically pinning the first day of the year to an agricultural or astronomical event. In Egypt, for instance, the year began with the annual flooding of the Nile, which coincided with the rising of the star Sirius. The first day of the Chinese new year, meanwhile, occurred with the second new moon after the winter solstice.

January 1 Becomes New Year’s Day

The early Roman calendar consisted of 10 months and 304 days, with each new year beginning at the vernal equinox; according to tradition, it was created by Romulus, the founder of Rome, in the eighth century B.C. A later king, Numa Pompilius, is credited with adding the months of Januarius and Februarius. Over the centuries, the calendar fell out of sync with the sun, and in 46 B.C. the emperor Julius Caesar decided to solve the problem by consulting with the most prominent astronomers and mathematicians of his time. He introduced the Julian calendar, which closely resembles the more modern Gregorian calendar that most countries around the world use today.

As part of his reform, Caesar instituted January 1 as the first day of the year, partly to honor the month’s namesake: Janus, the Roman god of beginnings, whose two faces allowed him to look back into the past and forward into the future. Romans celebrated by offering sacrifices to Janus, exchanging gifts with one another, decorating their homes with laurel branches and attending raucous parties. In medieval Europe, Christian leaders temporarily replaced January 1 as the first of the year with days carrying more religious significance, such as December 25 (the anniversary of Jesus’ birth) and March 25 (the Feast of the Annunciation); Pope Gregory XIII reestablished January 1 as New Year’s Day in 1582.

New Year’s Traditions and Celebrations 

In many countries, New Year’s celebrations begin on the evening of December 31—New Year’s Eve—and continue into the early hours of January 1. Revelers often enjoy meals and snacks thought to bestow good luck for the coming year. In Spain and several other Spanish-speaking countries, people bolt down a dozen grapes-symbolizing their hopes for the months ahead-right before midnight. In many parts of the world, traditional New Year’s dishes feature legumes, which are thought to resemble coins and herald future financial success; examples include lentils in Italy and black-eyed peas in the southern United States. Because pigs represent progress and prosperity in some cultures, pork appears on the New Year’s Eve table in Cuba, Austria, Hungary, Portugal and other countries. Ring-shaped cakes and pastries, a sign that the year has come full circle, round out the feast in the Netherlands, Mexico, Greece and elsewhere. In Sweden and Norway, meanwhile, rice pudding with an almond hidden inside is served on New Year’s Eve; it is said that whoever finds the nut can expect 12 months of good fortune.

Other customs that are common worldwide include watching fireworks and singing songs to welcome the new year, including the ever-popular “Auld Lang Syne” in many English-speaking countries. The practice of making resolutions for the new year is thought to have first caught on among the ancient Babylonians, who made promises in order to earn the favor of the gods and start the year off on the right foot. (They would reportedly vow to pay off debts and return borrowed farm equipment.)

In the United States, the most iconic New Year’s tradition is the dropping of a giant ball in New York City’s Times Square at the stroke of midnight. Millions of people around the world watch the event, which has taken place almost every year since 1907. Over time, the ball itself has ballooned from a 700-pound iron-and-wood orb to a brightly patterned sphere 12 feet in diameter and weighing in at nearly 12,000 pounds. Various towns and cities across America have developed their own versions of the Times Square ritual, organizing public drops of items ranging from pickles (Dillsburg, Pennsylvania) to possums (Tallapoosa, Georgia) at midnight on New Year’s Eve."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"The eight-day Jewish celebration known as Hanukkah or Chanukah commemorates the rededication during the second century B.C. of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, where according to legend Jews had risen up against their Greek-Syrian oppressors in the Maccabean Revolt. Hanukkah, which means “dedication” in Hebrew, begins on the 25th of Kislev on the Hebrew calendar and usually falls in November or December. Often called the Festival of Lights, the holiday is celebrated with the lighting of the menorah, traditional foods, games and gifts.

History of Hanukkah


The events that inspired the Hanukkah holiday took place during a particularly turbulent phase of Jewish history. Around 200 B.C., Judea—also known as the Land of Israel—came under the control of Antiochus III, the Seleucid king of Syria, who allowed the Jews who lived there to continue practicing their religion. His son, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, proved less benevolent: Ancient sources recount that he outlawed the Jewish religion and ordered the Jews to worship Greek gods. In 168 B.C., his soldiers descended upon Jerusalem, massacring thousands of people and desecrating the city’s holy Second Temple by erecting an altar to Zeus and sacrificing pigs within its sacred walls.

Did you know? The story of Hanukkah does not appear in the Torah because the events that inspired the holiday occurred after it was written. It is, however, mentioned in the New Testament, in which Jesus attends a ""Feast of Dedication.""
Led by the Jewish priest Mattathias and his five sons, a large-scale rebellion broke out against Antiochus and the Seleucid monarchy. When Matthathias died in 166 B.C., his son Judah, known as Judah Maccabee (“the Hammer”), took the helm; within two years the Jews had successfully driven the Syrians out of Jerusalem, relying largely on guerilla warfare tactics. Judah called on his followers to cleanse the Second Temple, rebuild its altar and light its menorah—the gold candelabrum whose seven branches represented knowledge and creation and were meant to be kept burning every night.

The Hanukkah “Miracle”

According to the Talmud, one of Judaism’s most central texts, Judah Maccabee and the other Jews who took part in the rededication of the Second Temple witnessed what they believed to be a miracle. Even though there was only enough untainted olive oil to keep the menorah’s candles burning for a single day, the flames continued flickering for eight nights, leaving them time to find a fresh supply. This wondrous event inspired the Jewish sages to proclaim a yearly eight-day festival. (The first Book of the Maccabees tells another version of the story, describing an eight-day celebration that followed the rededication but making no reference to the miracle of the oil.)

Other Interpretations of the Hanukkah Story

Some modern historians offer a radically different interpretation of the Hanukkah tale. In their view, Jerusalem under Antiochus IV had erupted into civil war between two camps of Jews: those who had assimilated into the dominant culture that surrounded them, adopting Greek and Syrian customs; and those who were determined to impose Jewish laws and traditions, even if by force. The traditionalists won out in the end, with the Hasmonean dynasty—led by Judah Maccabee’s brother and his descendants—wresting control of the Land of Israel from the Seleucids and maintaining an independent Jewish kingdom for more than a century.

Jewish scholars have also suggested that the first Hanukkah may have been a belated celebration of Sukkot, which the Jews had not had the chance to observe during the Maccabean Revolt. One of the Jewish religion’s most important holidays, Sukkot consists of seven days of feasting, prayer and festivities.

Hanukkah Decorations and Traditions

The Hanukkah celebration revolves around the kindling of a nine-branched menorah, known in Hebrew as the hanukiah. On each of the holiday’s eight nights, another candle is added to the menorah after sundown; the ninth candle, called the shamash (“helper”), is used to light the others. Jews typically recite blessings during this ritual and display the menorah prominently in a window as a reminder to others of the miracle that inspired the holiday.

In another allusion to the Hanukkah miracle, traditional Hanukkah foods are fried in oil. Potato pancakes (known as latkes) and jam-filled donuts (sufganiyot) are particularly popular in many Jewish households. Other Hanukkah customs include playing with four-sided spinning tops called dreidels and exchanging gifts. In recent decades, particularly in North America, Hanukkah has exploded into a major commercial phenomenon, largely because it falls near or overlaps with Christmas. From a religious perspective, however, it remains a relatively minor holiday that places no restrictions on working, attending school or other activities."

A whole day of shopping is the dream of every girl, especially the young ones, and the nightmare of parents, boyfriends and men in general. Going shopping is something very important, and almost necessary for some people, but what's the best place to go and do it?
Nowadays, shopping malls are very big and beautiful, full of shops and places where men can have a rest and children can have some fun, while mums and girlfriends are wasting their salaries. Moreover, in shopping malls shops close at 10 p.m. and are open also on Sunday, so also people that work all week can go there. The bad things are that in shopping malls there is always air conditioning, which is something that really annoys me, and there are no places where people can meet and have a conversation.
The best thing about going shopping downtown is surely the fact that we can walk in the open air and that we can see monuments while going from one shop to another. On the other hand, being in the open air has negative aspects, for example when it rains or snows it becomes impossible to do some shopping without getting stressed or ill!
In conclusion, I prefer going shopping in shopping malls just because there you can have a walk and relax : there are no cars honking at you and no sidewalks full of stressed people that push you because they are late! What chaos!

It offers a great variety of high quality woolen skirts, leather jackets and designer clothes. There are a lot of small boutiques in Kamianske. There you can buy fashionable clothes and shoes. For shoppers with big bank accounts, there is a wide range of jewellers'. Shops are usually open from eight or ten in the morning till about seven in the evening, from Monday to Saturday.

My dream is to visit Harrods. It is the most popular department store in the world.  Around 35000 people visit Harrods every day. It has got 300 departments spread over seven floors and employs over 4000 stuff. It also has eight doormen, known as 'Green Men', as well as its own fire brigade, security personnel, doctors and nurses.

Harrods is the official supplier of certain goods to the Royal Family, and sells everything from clothes to caviar.

Nowadays there are different ways of shopping. It’s becoming more and more popular to shop online. You just surf the Internet and look through the enormous range of goods.

Friends and relatives, exchange presents on this day and say to each other ""Happy New Year It is the time of joy and hopes for the better future.

A week later on the 7th of January is Christmas. The main Christmas meal, called or Holy Supper is eaten on Christmas Eve on the 6th of January. Families celebrate with holiday dishes made especially for the event. They contain no meat, dairy or animal fat. Twelve dishes symbolize the 12 apostles. One of the dishes is traditionally kutya, an ancient dish made from wheat, poppy seeds, and nuts, a dish that is shared by all family members. In some regions of Western Ukraine there is a tradition to decorate the table with ‘Didukh’ -- a sheaf of wheat of special shape. It symbolizes prosperity for the next year.

At the beginning of spring, on the 8th of March another popular holiday is celebrated. It is the Women’s Day. It is the day when we thank our women for everything they do for us. We congratulate them and give flowers and presents.

Easter is the most important festivity of the year for Christians. People usually dye eggs for Easter and bake Easter cake. On Easter Day Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Many Christian families go to church. The Easter baskets are blessed by the priest as part of the mass, and taken home by the families to eat in the morning.

April Fool’s Day is on 1 April. It’s the custom in Ukraine to play a trick or a joke on someone on this day.

The Day of Spring and Labour is celebrated on May 1st. On this day people prefer to go outdoors and take part in all kinds of outdoor activities.

After all, I am one of them, and every time I have some money, energy and desire to bring something new into my life, I cannot but assume that the easiest way to do so would be by going shopping. Clearly, a store is a place where I can relax and forget about all the troubles I had to deal with during the day and just let my personality shine.

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"What is a shopping bot?
A “shopping bot” is an electronic price comparison service.  Shopping bots are a convenient, rapid way to compare prices between multiple electronic vendors, and in some cases, traditional retail vendors.  In response to a query, such as an ISBN#, title, or brand/product description, a shopping bot will return a sorted list of prices and product descriptions, sometimes including comparative shipping costs.
Are shopping bots personal agents?
Software agents include some level of “artificial intelligence” or decision-refinement algorithms that evolve a solution from a simple query and take action on the query.  Current shopping bots are more akin to metasearch engines.  They do not fulfill a request, but merely return information in response to a query.  At present, shopping bots have not reached the point where they are software agents, but everyone expects shopping bots to evolve into personal software agents as the technology improves.  Most already include algorithms that “learn” from prior queries in order to return more useful information.
Where do shopping bots reside?
Most popular shopping bots are resident on the web, but some are programs that are downloaded by the user and are resident on the local hard drive.  The downloaded programs operate in a similar manner to the web-based interfaces, but with a different revenue model.  Web-based shopping bots generate revenues through a combination of advertising and commissions on sales linked through the shopping bot.  User resident programs generally can be downloaded as a shareware version with reduced functionality, or purchased as full-function software.  Because user-resident shopping bots do not usually r...

The war for portals has subsided, and the next battle will be between the search services, including shopping bots, and the actual vendors.

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Some persons with compulsive shopping disorder have had the condition for more than ten years, and this has contributed to the ruining of their social and financial lives. Some have reported as having to pay up debts once they get their monthly or weekly check before even buying their food. Some have been rendered homeless after spending all that they have on shopping with none to pay rent. The problem with them is that they shop for items, most of which they will never use (NewsRx, 2013). Many therapies have been tried to cure this addiction to shopping with little success. The treatment that has made significant improvement is the use of antidepressant drugs to make the patients lose the desire for shopping. These findings are however inconclusive.

Shopping is directly linked to the financial wellbeing of persons and should therefore be done in a prudent manner in order to avoid financial blunders or credit card defaults. The possibility of people being influenced by their moods to do sporadic shopping may create more problems. It is claimed that most of the items that are bought at the shopping malls are not required by the consumers. Most of them are acquired having not been planned for in the beginning (Krueger, 1988). The first hypothesis that will be tested in this research is ‘mood has an effect on one’s shopping patterns.’

The second hypothesis is in a way dependent on the first one being true, and it is as follows: ‘a negative mood leads to overspending/shopping.’ The first hypothesis is of correlational nature, as it is dependent on two phenomena being related, with one of them being influencer of the other. The second hypothesis is experimental. The state of mind of persons is causing them to have particular behavior will be to put the respondents on diets that are known to alter the moods for a week (a pilot study will be done first on my own friends and family to see if this diet actually has an effect on mood). This will then be followed by a study of how their shopping habits will turn out. The first experiment will include the foods that induce foul moods, such as chilies and very spicy foodstuffs. The moods of these subjects will further be made worse by having persons close to them disappoint or annoy them just before they go to the shopping mall. The music in the shopping mall will be changed and made less soothing and more interruptive (Raghunathan & Pham, 1999). This will ensure that the respondents are in the worst mood possible, and the catch will be that they will not be aware that they are being watched. Their shopping behavior in a foul mood will be recorded.

Analysis of questionnaires demonstrated that although online shopping is less expensive and more convenient, consumers still rather to shop in retail as of the less lengthy waiting process and to be able to have interactions with others within their society.

The number of consumers who tend to shop online is overestimated. Online shopping is portrayed as a fabulous and convenient method however in reality shoppers of the 21st century remain to have a preference of shopping in retail.

Most women enjoy going from one  store to another, looking for a blouse, only to go back to the first store to  get the blouse they looked at first. I hate shopping. Shopping wastes my time,  wastes my energy, and, if I do the typical woman routine, wastes my money. So,  do not ask me to go to the mall for the evening because I will respectfully  decline. I hate shopping.
I hate to be in the shoe department of a store. It seems that I always have  to wait for the salesperson who is waiting on Mrs. Shoe Queen. She is trying on  twenty pairs while I impatiently pace the carpet to threads. This is what I mean  by shopping is a waste of time. I, on the other hand, know what I want to  purchase before I leave the house.

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Holiday Shopping

As I skim through the Chadwick’s mail-order catalog, I come across a woman, who looks as if she is in her mid-thirties, standing outside on the snow-covered ground. Her gloved hand is arched back in a ready-to-throw position with a snowball resting in her palm.  The woman is wearing a ¾ length gray wool coat and black leather gloves, which catches my eye.  The serene, white-topped leaves of the pine trees lean in different directions, waiting for spring to arrive.  “Winter is a breeze if you buy this coat” is the message I receive from this friendly-gestured woman.  This warm, easy feeling especially comes into play during the holiday season when we buy gifts for our friends and family.



Shopping can be either a spiritual or an appalling experience.  Shopping by mail or online seems suited to casual shoppers.  It is a way to get what you need, without the long lines, angry customers and big crowds.  This method is particularly more convenient during the holiday season when there is an excessive amount of chaos as people shop for their loved ones.  To avoid all the hustle and bustle, you can order what you want online with the responsibility of considering the delivery times.  With this in mind I decided to try ordering a gray mid-length, button-down peacoat that I saw in  Chadwick’s mail-order catalog.  Although I saw this coat in the catalog, I was interested in ordering the product online.



Chadwick’s Web site is very informational. It has specific categories which are very helpful to me as an online customer.  All I have to do to place an order is click on Quick Order and there are two boxes: in one box you type the item number and in the box below that you enter the catalog item number.  After that lives. Shopping by online  tripled last year (Lowery 9).



Customers are quick to fall into the category of “belonging” found in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.  They feel as if in order to belong or to feel loved and respected by others they must try to attain what everyone else has or wants.  This is especially true during the holiday season when people feel that what they buy reflects how they feel about the people they buy presents for.  If you feel that you must purchase a certain present that you know will be out of stock and hard to find, you are better off shopping online or by mail.  Shopping online and by mail is becoming the new wave of shopping and it is a smart, convenient, and timesaving process."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Supermarkets and checkouts.

The advancements in the technological world have allowed supermarket chains and other national stores to quickly dominate the market and are driving out the concept of the ‘local stores’. This surge in the market has seen shares rise and profits bulge with the three main contenders in mind being Sainsburys, Safeways and Tescos who now serve the whole of the UK between them and are the household names of the shopping world. The ICT input to these businesses is vital in that it provides speedy service; controls stock levels and will even allow bank balance transfers to be carried out with minimal difficulty or technical experience.



The ‘till’, arguably a simple word has been given several names in the information technology world depending on the tasks, which the one in question can perform.



· POS- Point Of Sale terminal (ordinary checkout)



· EPOS- Electronic Point Of Sale terminal (Checkout connected to a computer data base using a laser scanner to read bar codes).



· EFTPOS- Electronic Funds Transfer Point Of Sale (the same as EPOS with the capability to make transfers for customers to pay for goods via credit or debit cards. The checkout uses the ICC (integrated chip card which is very popular on the continent) or Magnetic strip on the card to request the information of the user to see whether or not they are eligible to make an EFT. The magnetic strip can only hold a limited amount of data such that an 11 or so digit code is sufficient to recall the same data from the bank servers. The ICC however can hold much more information and is much harder to copy or have data changed by criminals or hackers.



The checkouts used in modern supermarket chains are all capable of EFT and are therefore all considered EFTPOS. In the next few years checkouts or ‘tills’ in all retail shops will use the ICC Barcodes The goods found in supermarkets are labelled with barcodes used to identify specific items on a central database. When the good is scanned a request is sent from the checkout to this main database where the request is handled and the appropriate information returned to that terminal and the correct amount reduced from the stock of that item. The bar codes are formed of lines of different widths and as each line represents a number the resulting code is the information sent to the main computer.

It has wide spread uses ranging from obtaining information, downloading files, business advertisement to Internet commerce, which plays a major part in Internet practice. Our social structure is pressuring society to connect to the Internet, with schools world wide becoming more Web based and universities now have lectures, which can be solely viewed over the Internet. Within the next few years the potential and capabilities of the Internet are endless. With that in mind the following assignment will examine a continuously flourishing component of the Internet, Internet shopping. Although Internet shopping is on the increase, it will never surpass conventional shopping, as the ?experience of shopping? is lost, it is open to fraud and the ?try before you buy? concept does not occur. From this information, it could be stated, ?The promise of Internet shopping is drowning in a flood of deceit, customer dissatisfaction, fraud and misappropriation. The Internet is best known for being a information superhighway, not a superhighway to the shopping mall.?



Shopping from the convenience and comfort of your own home may have its apparent advantages; no more standing in line, no more hassles. Currently people are using the Internet for shopping largely as it offers some benefits when compared with conventional shopping, for a narrow range of goods and services. Given that, there are still concerns about risks involved ? many issues from security of credit cards to privacy



Purchasing products from the Internet has major disadvantages when compared to conventional shopping. A significant problem is you cannot see the store you are buying from. On the Internet, it can be difficult to know whether the business you are dealing with is honest or not. When your credit card number is given to a marketing site in order to purchase goods, there is no certain guarantee that it will be used for the purpose it was intended for. Many unscrupulous internet web sites, use promises of miracle cures, and other hoaxes in order to exploit their users in an effort to gain credit card numbers and use them, for their own personal gain. However many web sites are creditable, but the security of their web page then may be violated. (By ?Hackers security features and customer service standards, consumers will discontinue to use Internet shopping altogether

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Nowadays, shopping is a part of our life, people buy the things everyday such as food, clothes, shoes, books and so on. Everything what we need we need to pay money for it. This is the human native, wo can not produce everything we need. Therefore, we have to use a thing which it is valuable to change the other thing what we need. Most of people use the money. What do people need, people will sell it. In the past, people will go to store to buy what do they need, but now, there is a new mode which is very popular to buy things. People can stay at home and just move their fingers, then they can buy everything they want. This is the network market. Shopping online and shopping in the store are the two most popular way that people buy things. In my opinion,with the development of the times, I think the shopping online is better than shopping in the store.

Firstly, shopping online is a really save time way to shopping. Can you feel you waste half hour to find a store? I believe, finding a store at a street is a terrible thing. However, shopping online we do not need to waste time to find a store or a product. We can just type the name of the store or the product and we can see on the screen, we also can know the price, texture, color, look and so on, all the information of the product. It is save the time we find the shop and the introduction of the salesperson. And the store we find online is over the country even over the world that makes us can choose the best one we find. Further more, if we shopping in the mall, walking one hour is the minimum charge, that is very tired. Specially for the men, shopping with their girlfriend or wife in the mall, it is like a nightmare. Because men usually are not interested in shopping, but not Lastly, shopping online is much cheaper than shopping in the store. Because online store do not need to hire large number to sale, they do not need to pay the rent of the store, they save much more payout, so the online stores normally are cheaper than the real stores. We can compare many stores online and find the cheapest one but it is find a same thing in a mall so we can not compare the price of the same product. If we want to buy something on sale in the store we need to wait until the store on sale, but we can get the discount when we shopping online everyday, even if one store stops the on sale, we also can find the other store. The on sale never stop at online store.

All in all,for the lazy people, shopping online is better than shopping in the store. Even though shopping in the store have some benefits, shopping online will be the chose by most people.

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"There are many different ways to shop. To some people, shopping is a chore and is approached in that manner. These shoppers know what they need, go get the items they need, and leave. To others shopping is just for fun. These people can spend an entire day window shopping and buy absolutely nothing. To others, myself included, shopping is a combination of both of the above mentioned. I like to call it bargain shopping because it means you are not just shopping for the item you want, but for the best bargain. It combines knowing what you want and getting it for the best price by shopping around. Bargain shopping takes time because you must use different resources such as newspaper ads, consumer reports, and the internet, to name a few. These resources can be used to find bargains on clothing, make-up, electronics and travel arrangements.
             When you shop for clothing, there are a few different techniques that can be used to ensure getting the best deal. Of course, there are newspapers filled with advertisements from vendors with the 25% off everything in the store special. This resource is good to get an idea for getting started on the search for the best bargains and getting an idea of what one wants. For example, last week I was planning on shopping for new bras, and found my Elder-Beerman advertisement offering 25% off the regular price of Playtex bras plus buy one get two free. If you are looking for a real bargain when buying clothes, the best thing to do is buy your clothes at the end of the season. For example, if you need a new coat do not buy it in September, when winter is almost upon us. You should buy a coat in December or January, when most stores put them on clearance. Better yet, buy it the year before you need it. You should know at the end of the season if you are going to need new clothing for next year.

Along with these pleasurable holiday experiences, another more frustrating task must be confronted: the long and arduous task of shopping for gifts for friends and loved ones. In recent years, the use of online Internet shopping has helped to transform this chore and the drudgery of everyday shopping. No longer must shoppers trudge store-to-store seeking the best bargain or finding that elusive item because the use of the Internet as a shopping medium has empowered shoppers with advantages over traditional storefront shopping.
             One of the primary advantages shoppers have discovered with Internet shopping is an increase in the time available for shopping.

These online stores can not only be accessed anytime a shopper has a free moment; but also provide the shopper with the benefits of avoiding traditional shopping hassles like crowded stores, long checkout lines, and congested parking lots. This increase in convenience and access has led many consumers to use the Internet for day-to-day shopping needs. Consumers who have difficulty walking or limited transportation are able to choose and purchase needed items without depending or the assistance of others to drive them to town or purchase items for them when they are unable to make the trip to the traditional stores. With the convenience of shipping offered by these online stores, purchased items are delivered to the buyer's front door which limits concerns over struggling with bulky packages.

             Christmas holidays are synonymous with laughter, carols and family gatherings. Along with these pleasurable holiday experiences, another more frustrating task must be confronted: the long and arduous task of shopping for gifts for friends and loved ones. In recent years, the use of online Internet shopping has helped to transform this chore and the drudgery of everyday shopping. No longer must shoppers trudge store-to-store seeking the best bargain or finding that elusive item because the use of the Internet as a shopping medium has empowered shoppers with advantages over traditional storefront shopping.

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,," The five competitive forces were analyzed. The rivalry in the industry is strong. Wine producers want their wine to be the best wine out there. The competitive environment is harsh for especially for small wineries. The costs can get to unbearable for them to be competing with larger wineries. Large wineries have most of the market share. 
             The potential entry of new competitors is a low level. It is hard for small wineries to compete well and stay alive in the wine business. The industry is very large. Just by going into a liquor store, you can see all the varieties of wine. Most wineries are family owned and have been passed down from generation to generation for many years. A bigger winery has a better chance of surviving, but the rivalry is so strong. 
             There is a high level of substitute products for wine. Wine is an alcoholic drink and there are many to choose from. There are many different kinds of beers and liquors. Beer and some liquor are less expensive. Some people drink on a weekly basic and do not want to spend a lot of money every week on alcohol, so they drink whatever is cheaper, and wine is not a cheap drink when compared to other alcoholic drinks. 
             The bargaining power of the supplier to seller is a moderate to high level. The grapes are an important part of the wine. Wine producers will pay a high price to get quality grapes. The vineyards have some power in the pricing of their grapes. Wine producers have been known to compete aggressively and make the prices high. Some wine producers will go into a contract with well-known quality grape producers, or they will buy a vineyard to avoid the bidding war to get good grapes. 
             The bargaining power of the seller to buyer is a low to moderate level. It is illegal to sell wine directly in the United States unless there is a gift shop on the property. Wine producers do not have a lot of say when bargaining with distributors because they need"
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,," In today's highly adversarial unionized workplace, both union and management negotiators involved in collective bargaining are constantly trying to find better ways to improve efficiency and relationships at the bargaining table. For years unions and management have fought against each other's positions, not taking into consideration the relationships between the two. In the traditional bargaining approach, the two parties exchange proposals in order to obtain target positions. There are several reasons this approach is not always the best approach, which I will explain in detail later in this paper. The traditional collective bargaining process is described as being ""based on mistrust and conflict – that is, there is a fundamental divergence of interest between employers and employees"" (Pettinger, 2000, pp 59). In traditional bargaining, the two sides act as adversaries, causing the two sides to lose trust in each other. When this happens negotiations often break down resulting in impasses. When an impasse is reached, the union can strike or management can lockout causing workers valuable working time and companies to lose valuable production time. To help avoid impasses, a more allied approach to negotiating has been developed to aid in the relationships between the two sides, as well as to help aid in the negotiation process.
             Mutual Gains Bargaining (MGB) originated in Japanese industrial relations where both sides of the bargaining table approached the negotiations by working toward a common goal through cooperation between the two sides (Abbey, 1996, pp 21). Mutual gains bargaining (also known as principled negotiations, interest-based bargaining, integrative bargaining, or win-win bargaining) focuses on the interests of the two parties instead of the positions. The two parties disclose to one another their interests before negotiations and work together as one team to mutually come to a decision. When used properly"
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,," The first objective of the research was to understand the concepts behind online shopping and to analyse the existing literature. Further down, this aspect was categorised under three sections, starting with the reasons behind shopping online.
             When asked to select one primary reason for shopping online, among the five common factors, convenience is the most frequently chosen reason for shopping online, based on the results from the survey, Q 12, which was main reasons to shop online was further analysed by dividing into two parts, male and female. And after drilling down further, the results showed, Majority of females shopped because of convenience but on the other hand males shopped online for some other reason and that was special offers followed by Convenience. This was re-emphasised by Chigar, (2001) where he conducted a shopping survey and results were similar to the present research conducted i.e., about 67 % of respondents in his study said convenience were main reason to buy via online. In another study conducted by Darian, (1987) on Home shoppers, it was found that people buy online because there are five types of convenience through home shopping.
             The next important factor, both combined (male & female) was special offers, and if drilled down further, for males 2nd most important reason to shop online and was save time, Even according to Chen, (2003) The ability to shop online without leaving the house and to have the ordered products delivered to the door is of great interest to many consumers, and this was clearly shown in the results. 
             3rd most reason for shopping online was cheaper goods and if we look at sex wise then females respondent's option was save time and for male respondents was cheaper goods, As Chen, (2003) said the use of price as a bait to win over consumers is evident in the success of Amazon.com who heavily advertises lower prices for the same books one can find from local bookstores."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Over the years the world has seen a change in shopping trends. Consumers continue to spend more money while companies are constantly coming out with new products. Shopping malls are not the only retailers that have added conveniences to the daily shopper. Supermarkets are also attempting to attract customers by using the same tactics. Added convenience has come from the creations of florals, bakeries, and coffee stands in the supermarket. When they are at shopping malls and supermarkets, consumers would always try to find a way to save time as they shop for products that reconcile their needs. Because of this trend, shoppers have found the newest and most convenient way to shop and have resorted to big mega stores. The CCSI (Central California Futures Institute) states, ""The mega-stores have the potential of not only taking over the at˜moderate frequency shoppers, but also some of the at˜core frequent shoppers, especially working women with children. The mega-stores will also begin to have greater attraction for the educated, affluent and professional frequent female and male secondary shopper"" (Penbera).
             
             The creation of the shopping mall is a classic example of how consumers have always looked to buy things in the most convenient manner. The shopping center, shopping mall, or shopping plaza, is the modern adaptation of the historical marketplace. The mall is a collection of independent retail stores, services, and a parking area, which is conceived, constructed, and maintained by a separate management firm as a unit. They may also contain restaurants, banks, theaters, professional offices, service stations etc. (Belles). During the 1950s when the era of mass production and mass consumption had started, shopping malls had begun to rationalize as well as industrialize the shopping market.

A lot of todays' organisations, in order to be in competition, have to create new strategies to stay a step ahead of each other. The owners of these organisations have to come up with new ideas to have customers all year round. What makes us as customers want to shop from a particular business? Is it because of the company's service? The product the company sells? All these questions are significant to any organisation. This paper will mainly focus on evaluating the main strategies that Amazon, Debenhams and Gap have adopted in detail.
             
             Amazon 
             
             Amazon.com was recognized in 1995 by Jeffrey P. Bezos, who started the business as an online book retailer and since then has quickly diversified by adding a wide range of other items such as, DVDs, music CD's, video games, electronics, clothing and furniture. Amazon is one of the biggest e-retailers in the US, United Kingdom, Europe and Asia. Moreover, Amazon has great competitive edge as being the inventor in the e-commerce. However, at the end of 2006, Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos reviewed the company's performance since being established. Amazon.com has consistently lost money, after eight years of negative income. The company did not start making a profit until 2003, in 2004 sales reached $5.3 billion, the profits then dipped in 2005, according to Rugman and Collinson (2006, p14). Today, more than two million small businesses, world-class retail labels and individual sellers use the Amazon.com e-commerce platform.

             Debenhams was established in the eighteenth century as a single store, this was opened in Cheltenham in London and has now grown to more than 230 stores across 28 countries and it is also available online in seventy countries, which have allowed the company to become the eleventh biggest UK online retailer of traffic volume.

Because of the stress it takes simply to prepare for such an event, I cannot even bring myself to enter a mall on some days. Shopping is a rigorous task but the hardest part is not the actual shopping but the pre-shopping that wares the average person out. 
             When I plan to go shopping I must find the energy to flip through my cluttered phonebook to find someone with the same stamina. Then once a partner is found I have to take a quick shower, doing only the bare minimum to achieve the fastest time to get in and out. Often I try to do multiple tasks while in the shower trying to lather my hair while balancing on one leg shaving is one I have conquered. I have the scars to prove it. My mind is busy worrying about what I will wear as the partially warm water washes over my hair to my toes. Racing through the routine I finally get out planning to get dressed.
             Then comes the actually getting dressed that takes the most out of me. The only reason I am going shopping is to find something to wear depressing my mood to find a temporary outfit. The cluttered closet, with only partially hung items, is enough to rethink the whole going out idea. There are the drawers of the last season clothes that will not do. The colors that I do not know what I was thinking when I bought them. The favorite clothes that I managed to stain. Or the finally comfortable dress, that now has a hole in it. There are the items grandmother knitted that won't see the light of day; especially since I have no clue what they actually are supposed to be worn on. And always the pants you wish you could still fit into with out lying on the bed for an hour to zip them up only to walk like a bowlegged cowboy, and pray you will be able to get them off.

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Compulsive Shopping
             Compulsive shopping is an affliction that affects 15 million
             Americans (13.5 million women and 1.5 million men). (Bertagnoli, 2003)
             Compulsive shopping, or the risk of becoming a compulsive shopper, affects
             approximately between two and eight percent of Americans. (Chaker, 2003)
             But, what is this condition known to the psychiatric community as
             Oniomania'
             Oniomania, in its simplest definition, is an obsession with purchasing
             items. Those suffering from compulsive shopping find themselves purchasing
             items they don't need. They often purchase multiples of an item. Deborah
             Rodriguez, a confirmed compulsive shopper, related coming ""home with six
             packages of clothespins even though she didn't own a clothesline.""
             (Chaker, 2003) Acknowledging this pattern of behavior as a problem is step
             one in finding a cure; uncovering the causes of the behavior is the next
             step.
             Some professionals surmise that compulsive shopping is an emotional
             disorder. Those suffering from this problem often use the purchasing of
             products to fill an emotional void in their lives. Many try to replace
             missing love and affection with the purchasing of items. Others hide
             behind their purchasing habits, from real life situations. Karen Patterson
             (2003) states that these purchases ""create and remind one of one's
             identity, create feelings of well-being to counter feelings of
             emotional or social emptiness, express the self for self-
             gratification.""
             The cause, for this disorder, may take root in social causes as well.
             It may be a learned behavior from parents of children who used material
             rewards. Americans also have the tendency to equate material items with
             success and social status. Keeping up with the Jones'' has never been

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,," In the twenty- first century, a lot of changes have been made to make it easier to shop. An example of this is the e-shopping of cars. To show an example I will evaluate two companies that started this trend of major product shopping: Volvo and Saturn.
             Although these two companies have a big price difference (since Volvo is considered a luxury automobile and Saturn and economic family car), they both want to serve their clients in the best way possible. 
             I first noticed this kind of shopping on television when a commercial of Saturn was on air, showing how simple it is to buy a car. I, on the other hand, found that although Saturn's e-shopping site was easy to find via the search engine and media Television, it lacked in customer support and information. Volvo's e-shopping site was incredibly hard to find and could only be accessed with a password that you had to obtain from a dealer. After accessing the site, I noticed that all the information I needed was at my fingertips. All the information regarding the colors available, information on the engine, the power, and even how to make an appointment with a dealer for a private test drive was readily available. 
             The design of the Volvo site was absolutely terrific. It was full of information, a chat table for any questions you may have and a 3-D window that can actually be used to look at the interior of the car that you choose and this, in a 360-degree fashion. Saturn was completely different in comparison to Volvo. The site was very basic. It offered only a couple of pictures , some technical information of the car as well as a toll free number for those who would like to test-drive the car. 
             Both these sites offered the visitor two purchase options. The car may be purchased directly at the dealer's place of business or the salesperson could come to you and complete the purchase agreement. Those who think that there is a saving to be had when they shop via the internet"

I said hi to the guys who work in the coffee shop, but I got no reply. I guessed they were not paying attention of me. I went to the table at the back, by the window, where I could see flowers in their backyards. That was the table where I usually sat. 
             I waited for a while. The waiter, who always looks cool and handsome, was cleaning the sticker table and singing the stupid song by Fifty-Cent with a headset on. He was finally noticed me and came over took my order with his Mickey Mouse's notebook and pen as usual. Then he went back to fix my coffee and sang with a girl voice. I was worried that his saliva would drop in my coffee. Finally, I could enjoy my coffee with his song. The weird looks guy that sat by him, who was the manger, was eating popcorn and drinking a cup of hot coffee. He was watching the most exciting football game with the black and white, old TV.

It has been the secret of the suburbs since its first major refurbishment in 1983, when it diverted from the Australian convention of 'strip-shopping' and took a step towards following the American model of a shopping centre. 'Chaddi', as its known more affectionately by its customers, is no more 10 minutes drive from the city centre, located on Princes Highway lying just inside the Stonnington regional boundary. The complex's niche lies within its menagerie of activities and selective mix of tenants, which together, attract a widespread demographic of consumers and provide the framework for the perfect shopping environment. 
             While currently one of the premier shopping complexes in Australia, Chadstone has undergone many phases of development and refinement to rise to its lofty position held at present. The Chadstone Mall was built in 1960 as a traditional Australian shopping venue, merely consisting of one road lined by shops on its flanks, covered by a tarpaulin for shelter. It remained this way until 1984, when the Gandel group acquired the then obsolete structure in May, and chose to invest $205 million over 18 years in its redevelopment. Sending its architects to the USA to carry out a reconnaissance of the successful and efficient American way of department shopping, Gandel architects mimicked their findings in the design of Chadstone Shopping Centre, as it is known today. The shopping centre has been resurrected from being the large trash and treasure market of the southeast, to being 'The Fashion Capital'; the epitome of a serious shopper's playground.

My mother is a beautician and owns her own beauty shop in our house. I like having a beauty shop in my house because I enjoy watching customers change their appearance by cutting, coloring, and perming their hair.
             There are many different ways to cut and style hair. Most customers already know how they want their haircut before they even make their appointment. However, some of them need assistance in making their decision. Many beauty shops provide magazines which contain new hair cutting styles and techniques. To choose the perfect haircut, you must consider the texture, thickness, and flexibility of your hair. People with short hair usually have thin, straight hair, where as people with thick hair tend to keep it longer than shoulder length.
             If the customer doesn't like the color of their hair, a good beautician can help. There is wide range of colors to choose from. Some people like to change their hair color drastically, while others just want to cover up their gray hair. In the summer, a lot of customers like to get their hair highlighted. This is where light blonde "" streaks"" are colored throughout their hair. It is a great way to get that sun glazed look.
             Another popular way to style your hair is with a perm. A perm makes waves or curls in your hair. The roller size you use makes all the difference. The smaller the roller, the smaller the curl. Perms are usually easy to fix. Most customers just wash their hair and go. The worst part about getting a perm is the smell. The smell is very strong, distinctive and will linger on past its welcome. Also, it is advisable not to wash your hair for twenty-four hours after you get the perm so that the curl can set.

You cannot say you've never been in a shopping mall. The main reason shopping malls are so popular is that they are very convenient. Most of them include clothing stores, a food court, movie theaters, arcade rooms, and much more. Not every shopping mall is the same, but they all basically have the same things. Which are shopping and a place to hang out and cruise with your friends, maybe even meet new people. Also shopping malls are for all ages, not just teenagers, and for all kinds of different people.
             When you go to a mall you will find the majority of the people in there are teenagers. The boys usually just want to eat and play video games, while the girls just want to shop and gossip. Many usually don't shop at all; they just want a place to hang out. And for most teenagers getting to your favorite shopping mall isn't that hard. They either have a car, or a friend with a car. Also, the bus stops right in front of the mall, or it is in walking distance of it. 
             A shopping mall brings in a lot of money, with holiday shopping and tourists. If you have ever been in a mall during the holidays you know how hectic it can get. There are moms fighting over the last toy her child wants and someone fighting over the last chocolate chip cookie at the cookie corner. Along with the holidays come the sales after it, which makes the perfect time to shop. This applies especially to Christmas. Also when the seasons change, sales come with it, as new shipments come in, with new styles. Plus with a shopping mall comes jobs and business. Many businesses hire when the holidays are near, but this is only seasonal employment. Discounts usually come with a job at the mall, so this makes getting a job there more appealing.

When Macy was 15, he joined a whaling ship that left New Bedford in December, 1837, and returned four years later. In 1844, when Macy was 22, he opened a thread-and-needle store in Boston and, two years later, a retail dry goods store in the same city. Macy was described as a stocky, bearded veteran of hard times; he was frugal and hot tempered. He was known to flirt with the girls on buying trips to Europe. In 1847, Macy went to work for his brother-in-law, George W. Houghton, a dry goods retailer in Boston. This ended quickly when Macy decided to leave with his brother Charles to California with the Forty-Niners. With his brother Charles B. Mitchell and Edward R. Anthony, Macy formed a partnership as Macy & Company in July 1850, at Marysville, California. The partnership ended just in two months.
             He then returned east and opened a store in April 1851, in Haverhill Massachusetts, under the name R. B. Macy, the initials of his brother, Robert, who had started the dry good business in Boston. At Haverhill Macy started the principles that later he took to New York. Principles like advertising, ""buy and sell for cash"" policy and the one-price concept. He also gave notice of attempting to undersell all competition in 1853.
             Macy stayed in business in Haverhill for four years. During this time he also would go to Wisconsin as a money and real estate broker. In 1858 at age 36 he returned to New York and opened an 11-foot-front store selling ribbons, laces, embroideries, artificial flowers, feathers, handkerchiefs, hosiery and gloves at 204-206 sixth avenue on 14 street in Manhattan. First day sales were $11.06. By the end of 1859 Macy's sales totaled to $90,000 and on an advertising budget of $2, 800. Within a month Macy began selling gloves and hosiery for men. By the fol"

On the one hand, shopping online brings consumers some disadvatages. Initially, since people are unable to touch or to see the products they want to buy in reality, it is always hard for them to examine the quality of these products. As a result, they might purchase the items with poor quality. In addition to that, as consumers do not feel happy with the items they had bought online, they tend to abandon these products or don't use them at all. This is definitely a watse of money. Moreover, buyings thing on the Internet often makes people confused since there are a great number of shops on the Internet. To be specific, buyers might see the same products in several shops, but the prices for these items can be very different, ranging from reasonable to prohibitedly expensive price. Consequently, they will not know which products they should purchase.

On the other hand, I am of opinion that shopping online brings people a number of benefits. First, shopping online allows consumers to browse for products and checking prices between these online shops . In this way, people can make a better decision to buy what they like after taking prices, sizes and models into consideration. From my experience, I used to buy an elegant dress at virtual shop, which was cheaper compared to some shops near my houses.

Second, buyings things on the Internet helps people save a great deal of time. That is to say, since people nowadays are often so caught up with work and study, shopping online is a wise choice which doesn't require them to go the the stores . With a click of mouse, they can buy the things they need and the shippers will deliver their products to customers as soon as possible.

Third, since there is a high demand of buying things online, many people can realize their dream of starting up their own business and achieve success in the long rub This can be seen as a positive trend because it creates good job opportunities for people and thereby help people to improve their income and well-being. This also contributes to boosting the economy of a nation in generall.

In conclusion, although buyings things on the Internet exerts some adverse aspects, the advantages can justify these."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"With the advent of technological advancement, 21st century has witnessed a boom in e-commerce. The number of online shopping websites is increasing exponentially. Shopping online has its upsides and downsides but the positives of this technological blessing far outweighs its negatives.
 
Firstly, online shopping saves one from travel and traffic problems. I live in the outskirts of Karachi and commuting to the city for buying stuff is not an easy task for me. Further, Karachi is an overly-populated city with the worst traffic situation, all this makes it more difficult to travel. This problem is hugely resolved by the e-buying facility. Everything is simply a click away, whether it is groceries, air tickets, clothes or books. Whatever I order is duly received at my doorstep, without my having to embark on long, hectic shopping-trips.
 
Secondly, buying things on the internet provides you with a wide range of options. Consider yourself in a gigantic super-mart having access to every type of item you can imagine! On the internet there is no physical space limitation, therefore the variety available for a single item is endless. Also, there are countless websites where you can compare product prices, specifications, extra features, deals and a lot more. One such website is Compare.Pk, where you can select an item and compare it with similar items of other brands for specifications and prices. All this not only provides convenience to customers but also exposes them to a very huge market for buying the most appropriate item.
 
In conclusion, it can be unambiguously agreed upon that the advancement in e-buying has resulted in convenience for buyers. One only has to select and order an item and it arrives at his doorstep. Also, the available options for a single commodity are endless, so that a person can compare and buy the best."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Shopping is a girl’s favorite hobby. We love it because we take the opportunity to spoil ourselves and we also use it as a getaway from reality.

1.
Credit/Debit cards are a girl’s best friend.

We love to shop until we drop, literally. Shopping relieves our stress and we get to be updated in fashion. Not even just clothes, but we also like to buy makeup whether it’s a new eye shadow palette, new mascara, or even new lipstick. Shopping is in our nature and it’s fun to do with your girls on a rainy day, or even when you’re feeling down.

2. Online shopping is great too!

When it’s stormy weather out there, and you’re not in the mood to go deal with the heavy rain as you run to your car, you also have the option to do some online shopping. The best part about online shopping is that there is always some kind of sale going on and 9 out of 10 times, you can have the option of receiving free shipping, which is a great bonus!


3. Shopping is a major stress reliever to us girl’s.

When we’re upset or just feeling down, shopping gives us a way of looking past that feeling and making ourselves happy by buying what we want. Nothing tops that feeling of getting what you want at the store and being excited for a night out to wear what you bought! That same feeling continues with makeup because we, as girls, get excited to try on new lipsticks and eye shadows as well when we are getting ready to go out.

It’s safe to say that if shopping weren’t so quickly available, us girls would have to find a new hobby. Shopping may be important to us because it gives us a means of escaping whatever stress we carry with us, or it can even be for enjoyment to make ourselves happy. It’s the best form of putting ourselves first and the best way to cheer ourselves up!"
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. A typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational shoppers,[1] that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity.[2]

Online shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry[3] as consumers can now search for product information and place product orders across different regions. Online retailers deliver their products directly to the consumers' home, offices or wherever they want. The B2C (business to consumer) process has made it easy for consumers to select any product online from a retailer's website and to have it delivered relatively quickly. Using online shopping methods, consumers do not need to consume energy by physically visiting physical stores. This way they save time and the cost of travelling. A retailer or a shop is a business that presents a selection of goods and offers to trade or sell them to customers for money or other goods.

Shoppers' shopping experiences may vary. They are based on a variety of factors including how the customer is treated, convenience, the type of goods being purchased, and mood.[4]

According to a 2000 report, in New York State, women purchase 80% of all consumer goods."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Antiquity

Remains of marketplace and retail shops at Trajan's Forum in Rome
In antiquity, marketplaces and fairs were established to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. People would shop for goods at a regular market in nearby towns. However, the transient nature of stalls and stall-holders meant the consumers needed to make careful inspection of goods prior to purchase. In ancient Greece, the agora served as a marketplace where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods.[6]

Ancient Rome utilized a similar marketplace known as the forum. Rome had two forums; the Forum Romanum and Trajan's Forum. Trajan's Market at Trajan's forum, built around 100-110CE, was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with tabernae that served as retail shops, situated on four levels.[7] The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shopfront.[7] In the Roman world, the central market primarily served the local peasantry. Those who lived on the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating their need to attend local markets.[8]

Shopping lists are known to have been used by Romans. One such list was discovered near Hadrian's wall dated back to 75–125 CE and written for a soldier.[9]"
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Archaeological evidence suggests that the British engaged in minimal shopping in the early Middle Ages. Instead, they provided for their basic needs through subsistence farming practices and a system of localised personal exchanges.[10] However, by the late Middle Ages, consumers turned to markets for the purchase of fresh produce, meat and fish and the periodic fairs where non-perishables and luxury goods could be obtained.[11] Women were responsible for everyday household purchases, but most of their purchasing was of a mundane nature. For the main part, shopping was seen as a chore rather than a pleasure.[12]

Relatively few permanent shops were to be found outside the most populous cities. Instead customers walked into the tradesman's workshops where they discussed purchasing options directly with tradesmen.[13] Itinerant vendors such as costermongers, hucksters and peddlers operated alongside markets, providing the convenience of home delivery to households, and especially to geographically isolated communities.[14]

In the more populous European cities, a small number of shops were beginning to emerge by the 13th century. Specialist retailers such as mercers and haberdashers were known to exist in London, while grocers sold ""miscellaneous small wares as well as spices and medicines."" However, these shops were primitive. As late as the 16th century, London's shops were described as little more than ""rude booths.""[15]

The Medieval shopper's experience was very different from that of the contemporary shopper. Interiors were dark and shoppers had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to consumption. Glazed windows in retail environments, were virtually unknown during the medieval period. Goods were rarely out on display; instead retailers kept the merchandise at the rear of the store and would only bring out items on request. The service counter was virtually unknown and instead, many stores had openings onto the street from which they served customers.[16]

In Britain, medieval attitudes to retailing and shopping were negative. Retailers were no better than hucksters, because they simply resold goods, by buying cheaper and selling dearer, without adding value of national accounts. Added to this were concerns about the self-interest of retailers and some of their more unethical practices. Attitudes to spending on luxury goods also attracted criticism, since it involved importing goods which did little to stimulate national accounts, and interfered with the growth of worthy local manufacturers."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"The modern phenomenon of shopping for pleasure is closely linked to the emergence of a middle class in the 17th and 18th-century Europe. As standards of living improved in the 17th century, consumers from a broad range of social backgrounds began to purchase goods that were in excess of basic necessities. An emergent middle class or bourgeosie stimulated demand for luxury goods and began to purchase a wider range of luxury goods and imported goods, including: Indian cotton and calico; silk, tea and porcelain from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.[18] The act of shopping came to be seen as a pleasurable pass-time or form of entertainment.[2]

By the 17th-century, produce markets gradually gave way to shops and shopping centres; which changed the consumer's shopping experience.[19] The New Exchange, opened in 1609 by Robert Cecil in the Strand was one such example of a planned shopping centre. Shops started to become important as places for Londoners to meet and socialise and became popular destinations alongside the theatre. Restoration London also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position with speculative architects like Nicholas Barbon and Lionel Cranfield.


Bernard Mandeville's work The Fable of the Bees, which justified conspicuous consumption.
Much pamphleteering of the time was devoted to justifying conspicuous consumption and private vice for luxury goods for the greater public good. This then scandalous line of thought caused great controversy with the publication of Bernard Mandeville's influential work Fable of the Bees in 1714, in which he argued that a country's prosperity ultimately lay in the self-interest of the consumer.[20]

These trends gathered momentum in the 18th century, as rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people with disposable income for consumption. Important shifts included the marketing of goods for individuals as opposed to items for the household, and the new status of goods as status symbols, related to changes in fashion and desired for aesthetic appeal, as opposed to just their utility. The pottery inventor and entrepreneur, Josiah Wedgewood, pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence and manipulate the direction of the prevailing tastes.[21] One of his preferred sales techniques was to stage expansive showcases of wares in this private residences or in a rented hall, to which he invited the upper classes.[22]

As the 18th-century progressed, a wide variety of goods and manufactures were steadily made available for the urban middle and upper classes. This growth in consumption led to the rise of 'shopping' - a proliferation of retail shops selling particular goods and the acceptance of shopping as a cultural activity in its own right. Specific streets and districts became devoted to retail, including the Strand and Piccadilly in London.[23]


Royal Arcade, Sydney, 1892
The rise of window shopping as a recreational activity accompanied the use of glass windows in retail shop-fronts. By the late eighteenth century, grand shopping arcades began to emerge across Britain, Europe and in the Antipodes in what became known as the ""arcade era.""[24] Typically, these arcades had a roof constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. Inside the arcade, individual stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Designed to attract the genteel middle class, retailers sold luxury goods at relatively high prices. However, prices were never a deterrent, as these new arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos of daily street life; a place shoppers could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid nineteenth century, promenading in these arcades became a popular pass-time for the emerging middle classes.[26]

In Europe, the Palais-Royal, which opened in 1784, became one of the earliest examples of the new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, cafés, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building.[27] In London, one of the first to use display windows in shops was retailer, Francis Place, who experimented with this new retailing method at his tailoring establishment in Charing Cross, where he fitted the shop-front with large plate glass windows. Although this was condemned by many, he defended his practice in his memoirs, claiming that he:

sold from the window more goods...than paid journeymen's wages and the expenses of housekeeping.[28]
Retailers designed attractive shop fronts to entice patronage, using bright lights, advertisements and attractively arranged goods. The goods on offer were in a constant state of change, due to the frenetic change in fashions. A foreign visitor commented that London was ""a world of gold and silver plate, then pearls and gems shedding their dazzling lustre, home manufactures of the most exquisite taste, an ocean of rings, watches, chains, bracelets, perfumes, ready-dresses, ribbons, lace, bonnets, and fruits from all the zones of the habitable world"""
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"In the second half of the 19th-century, shops transitioned from 'single-function' shops selling one type of good, to the department store where a large variety of goods were sold. As economic growth, fueled by the Industrial Revolution at the turn of the 19th-century, steadily expanded, the affluent bourgeois middle-class grew in size and wealth. This urbanized social group was the catalyst for the emergence of the retail revolution of the period.

The term, ""department store,"" originated in America. In 19th century England, these stores were known as emporia or warehouse shops.[29] A number of major department stores opened across the USA, Britain and Europe from the mid nineteenth century including; Harrod's of London in 1834; Kendall's in Manchester in 1836; Selfridges of London in 1909; Macy's of New York in 1858; Bloomingdale's in 1861; Sak's in 1867; J.C. Penney in 1902; Le Bon Marché of France in 1852 and Galeries Lafayette of France in 1905.

The first reliably dated department store to be established, was Harding, Howell & Co, which opened in 1796 on Pall Mall, London.[30] This venture was described as being a public retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different departments. This pioneering shop was closed down in 1820 when the business partnership was dissolved. Department stores were established on a large scale from the 1840s and 50s, in France, the United Kingdom and the US. French retailer, Le Bon Marche, is an example of a department store that has survived into current times Originally founded in 1838 as a lace and haberdashery store, it was revamped mid-century and opened as a department store in 1852.[31]

Many of the early department stores were more than just a retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Some department stores offered reading rooms, art galleries and concerts. Most department stores had tea-rooms or dining rooms and offered treatment areas where ladies could indulge in a manicure. The fashion show, which originated in the US in around 1907, became a staple feature event for many department stores and celebrity appearances were also used to great effect. Themed events featured wares from foreign shores, exposing shoppers to the exotic cultures of the Orient and Middle-East."

Window shopping in Ottawa, 1938
Shopping hubs, or shopping centers, are collections of stores; that is a grouping of several businesses in a compact geographic area. It consists of a collection of retail, entertainment and service stores designed to serve products and services to the surrounding region.

Typical examples include shopping malls, town squares, flea markets and bazaars.

Traditionally, shopping hubs were called bazaars or marketplaces; an assortment of stalls lining streets selling a large variety of goods.[33]

The modern shopping centre is now different from its antecedents, the stores are commonly in individual buildings or compressed into one large structure (usually called Mall in the USA).[34]

The first modern shopping mall in the US was The Country Club Plaza in Kansas City which opened in 1922, from there the first enclosed mall was designed by Victor Gruen and opened in 1956 as Southdale Centre in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.

Malls peaked in America in the 1980s-1990s when many larger malls (more than 37,000 sq m in size) were built, attracting consumers from within a 32 km radius with their luxurious department stores.[35]

Different types of malls can be found around the world. Superregional malls are very large malls that contain at least five department stores and 300 shops. This type of mall attracts consumers from a broad radius (up to a 160-km). A regional mall can contain at least two department stores or ""anchor stores"".[36] One of the biggest malls in the world is the one near Miami, called ""Sawgrass Mills Mall"": it has 2,370,610 square feet (220,237 m2) of retail selling space, with over 329 retail outlets and name brand discounters.

The smaller malls are often called open-air strip centres or mini-marts and are typically attached to a grocery store or supermarket.

The smaller malls are less likely to include the same features of a large mall such as an indoor concourse, but are beginning to evolve to become enclosed to comply with all weather and customer preferences."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Stores are divided into multiple categories of stores which sell a selected set of goods or services. Usually they are tiered by target demographics based on the disposable income of the shopper. They can be tiered from cheap to pricey.

Some shops sell secondhand goods. Often the public can also sell goods to such shops. In other cases, especially in the case of a nonprofit shop, the public donates goods to these shops, commonly known as thrift stores in the United States, charity shops in the United Kingdom, or op shops in Australia and New Zealand. In give-away shops goods can be taken for free. In antique shops, the public can find goods that are older and harder to find. Sometimes people are broke and borrow money from a pawn shop using an item of value as collateral. College students are known to resell books back through college textbook bookstores. Old used items are often distributed through surplus stores.

Various types of retail stores that specialize in the selling of goods related to a theme include bookstores, boutiques, candy shops, liquor stores, gift shops, hardware stores, hobby stores, pet stores, pharmacies, sex shops and supermarkets.

Other stores such as big-box stores, hypermarkets, convenience stores, department stores, general stores, dollar stores sell a wider variety of products not horizontally related to each other."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Home mail delivery systems and modern technology (such as television, telephones, and the Internet), in combination with electronic commerce, allow consumers to shop from home. There are three main types of home shopping: mail or telephone ordering from catalogs; telephone ordering in response to advertisements in print and electronic media (such as periodicals, TV and radio); and online shopping. Online shopping has completely redefined the way people make their buying decisions; the Internet provides access to a lot of information about a particular product, which can be looked at, evaluated, and comparison-priced at any given time. Online shopping allows the buyer to save the time and expense, which would have been spent traveling to the store or mall. According to technology and research firm Forrester, mobile purchases or mcommerce will account for 49% of ecommerce, or $252 billion in sales, by 2020"
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Convenience stores are common in North America, and are often called ""bodegas"" in Spanish-speaking communities or ""dépanneurs"" in French-speaking ones. Sometimes peddlers and ice cream trucks pass through neighborhoods offering goods and services. Also, garage sales are a common form of second hand resale.

Neighbourhood shopping areas and retailers give value to a community by providing various social and community services (like a library), and a social place to meet. Neighbourhood retailing differs from other types of retailers such as destination retailers because of the difference in offered products and services, location and popularity.[38] Neighbourhood retailers include stores such as; Food shops/marts, dairies, Pharmacies, Dry cleaners, Hairdressers/barbers, Bottle shops, Cafés and take-away shops . Destination retailers include stores such as; Gift shops, Antique shops, Pet groomers, Engravers, Tattoo parlour, Bicycle shops, Herbal dispensary clinics, Art galleries, Office Supplies and framers. The neighbourhood retailers sell essential goods and services to the residential area they are located in. There can be many groups of neighbourhood retailers in different areas of a region or city, but destination retailers are often part of shopping malls where the numbers of consumers is higher than that of a neighbourhood retail area. The destination retailers are becoming more prevalent as they can provide a community with more than the essentials, they offer an experience, and a wider scope of goods and services."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Shopping seasons
Shopping frenzies are periods of time where a burst of spending occurs, typically near holidays in the United States, with Christmas shopping being the biggest shopping spending season, starting as early as October and continuing until after Christmas.

Some religions regard such spending seasons as being against their faith and dismiss the practice. Many contest the over-commercialization and the response by stores that downplay the shopping season often cited in the War on Christmas.

The National Retail Federation (NRF) also highlights the importance of back-to-school shopping for retailers which comes second behind holiday shopping, when buyers often buy clothing and school supplies for their children.[39] In 2017, Americans spent over $83 billion on back-to-school and back-to-college shopping, according to the NRF annual survey.[40]

Seasonal shopping consists of buying the appropriate clothing for the particular season. In winter people bundle up in warm layers and coats to keep warm, while in summer people wear less clothing to stay cooler in the heat. Seasonal shopping now revolves a lot around holiday sales and buying more for less. Stores need to get rid of all of their previous seasonal clothing to make room for the new trends of the upcoming season.[41] The end-of-season sales usually last a few weeks with prices lowering further towards the closing of the sale. During sales items can be discounted from 10% up to as much as 50%, with the biggest reduction sales occurring at the end of the season. Holiday shopping periods are extending their sales further and further with holidays such as Black Friday becoming a month-long event stretching promotions across November . These days shopping doesn't stop once the mall closes, as people have more access to stores and their sales than ever before with the help of the internet and apps.[42] Today many people research their purchases online to find the cheapest and best deal with one third of all shopping searches on Google happen between 10:00 pm and 4:00 am.[43] Shoppers are now spending more time consulting different sources before making a final purchasing decision. Shoppers once used an average of five sources for information before making a purchase, but numbers have risen to as high as 12 sources in 2014."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Historically, prices were established through a system of barter or negotiation. The first retailer to adopt fixed prices is thought to be the retailers operating out of the Palais-Royal complex in the 18th-century. These retailers adopted a system of high price maintenance in order to cultivate images of luxury. For their upper class clientele, fixed prices spared them from hassle of bartering.[45]

The pricing technique used by most retailers is cost-plus pricing. This involves adding a markup amount (or percentage) to the retailers' cost. Another common technique is manufacturers suggested list pricing. This simply involves charging the amount suggested by the manufacturer and usually printed on the product by the manufacturer.

In retail settings, psychological pricing or odd-number pricing are both widely used. Psychological pricing which refers to a range of tactics, designed to have a positive psychological impact. For example, price tags using the terminal digit ""9"" (e.g., 9.99, 19.99, or 199.99) can be used to signal price points and bring an item in at just under the consumer's reservation price.[46] However, in Chinese societies, prices are generally either a round number or sometimes some lucky number. This creates price points.

In a fixed-price system, consumers may still use bargaining or haggling; a negotiation about the price. Economists see this as determining how the transaction's total economic surplus will be divided between consumers and producers. Neither party has a clear advantage because the threat of no sale exists, in which case the surplus would vanish for both.

When shopping online, it can be more difficult to negotiate price given that you are not directly interacting with a sales person. Some consumers use price comparison services to locate the best price and/or to make a decision about who or where to buy from to save money."

Window shopping in the rain
""Window shopping"" is a term referring to the browsing of goods by a consumer with or without the intent to purchase. Window shopping is often practised by a particular segment, known as the recreation-conscious or hedonistic shopper. Recreational shopping is characterised by the consumer's engagement in the purchase process, and recreational shoppers are those consumers who see the act of shopping as a form of enjoyment.[47] Other consumers use window shopping as part of their planning activity for a later purchase.

Showrooming, the practice of examining merchandise in a traditional retail store without purchasing it, but then shopping online to find a lower price for the same item, has become an increasingly prevalent problem for traditional retailers as a result of online competitors, so much so that some have begun to take measures to combat it."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Shopping addicts, set aside your guilt this Memorial Day weekend - we've got good news. It turns out your mall addiction adds up to more than a hurting wallet - it increases longevity.

Based on a survey of 1,200 U.S. respondents, one in three Americans will be traveling over the Memorial Day weekend, reports TripAdvisor. This means hundreds of thousands of Americans will be getting a healthy perk on top of sales. Shopping sprees offer health benefits linked to positive physical and mental health for individuals of all ages.

And for those with a little more self-control, window shopping is just as advantageous. Lisa Tillinger Johansen, registered dietician and health educator at Kaiser Permanente, told Medical Daily. ""I like shopping from a walking standpoint. It's movement which is good for our bodies and weight management. It's also a stress reliever and mood enhancer,"" she said.

We've outlined the top five health benefits of shopping below. They're sure to cast away that usual guilt. Shop 'til you drop, ladies!
"
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Shopping is associated with a sense of achievement. Think about the time you scored a vintage necklace from your local neighborhood thrift shop. You were elated to find a piece of jewelry that was unique and within your budget. The heightened emotions of happiness release endorphins, known as the ""feel good"" chemicals in your brain. Endorphins help you refocus your mind on your body movements, improving your overall mood.A UK study conducted at Brunel University correlated the effect of shopping on the left prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that is linked to pleasure and positive thinking. Researchers found that levels of dopamine increase during pleasurable experiences such as window shopping. The surges in dopamine levels are more linked to the anticipation of a shopping experience versus the shopping experience itself. A study published in the Journal Neuron, researchers at MIT, Carnegie Mellon, and Stanford gathered volunteers to strap onto a MRI machine to show them pictures of products. Dopamine levels escalated when shoppers saw something they wanted to buy, which caused their MRI images to light up on the dashboard. The production of dopamine plays an essential role in behavior, cognition, mood, attention, working memory, learning, and so much more.
"
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"When you shop, you socially interact with people around you - whether they're fellow shoppers or sales associates. In addition, shopping with a best friend, partner, or family member provides a bonding experience that can reduce stress levels. In a study published by the American Psychological Association (APA), levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, were tested in kids who were with their best friend versus kids who were alone during a negative experience. Kids who were with their best friends during a negative experience produced less levels of cortisol than their counterparts, which suggests any form of bonding can be good for the mind, body, and soul.

Tillinger Johansen said to Medical Daily, ""Shopping with others is good for social interaction. It can be good for our sense of belonging, affect our mood and relieve stress (hopefully)!""

Get your guy to come on your next shopping trip.

Men and women tend to think about clothes shopping differently. Trying to get your guy to go shopping with you can seem like a dead end until now. Both sexes were asked to think about clothes shopping and then plot a trip on a map in a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research. The results of the study showed men planned the most direct driving route whereas women were more likely to opt for the scenic route. Applied to shopping, the researchers found men tend to shop for specific items when needed whereas women browse for items to see what is available.

A solution to a much dreaded mall trip with your guy is to individually visit your designated stores and meet up for a quick lunch shortly afterward.

3. Improves mental acuity.

The mental, physical, and social engagement of shopping can keep your perception intact even in old age. When you shop, you are physically active by walking, going up and down escalators, and trying on clothes. The mental component of shopping is introduced when you revise your budget, check which on-sale item is better, and calculate your total cost. Socially, you meet up with friends or you hold small-talk with an employee at a department store.

It's essential to keep your mental acuity in focus as you age. Therefore, shopping can be a preventative health measure to dementia, an illness that affects many adults in the beginning of their 60s.

4. Live longer.

Grab a shopping cart if you want to live longer. The act of shopping can reduce the risk of death in the elderly by 27 percent, reports a study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. Daily shopping trips were linked to an increase in survival rate with the collection of data of approximately 2,000 elderly men and women aged 65 and over from Taiwan and the statistics of the country's National Death Registration from 1999 to 2008.

""For example, elders may maintain a mall walking routine, perhaps regarded as shopping activity, although more to do with the need to belong to a community or keep physically active in a safe and convenient environment,"" says the study.

5. Exercise.


Ladies, it's time to go hunt for those deals and bargains in your exercise gear! Shopping from one department store to the next while you carry heavy bags has been proven to be a good workout for the heart and body. Debenhams, a department store in the UK, tested ten shoppers, five male and five female, with pedometers and surveyed 2,000 female shoppers to calculate the health benefits of a shopping trip. The study found the average person can lose up to 400 calories by walking from shop to shop carrying heavy bags.

Women who spend significant amounts of time shopping have been linked to reduce risk of cardiovascular diseases and other related health issues because of the physical activity.

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Due to the rapid advancement in technology many supermarkets introduced
online shopping for food. Many people prefer to buy food in supermarkets while other people go for online shopping. this essay will discuss why online shopping has its own benefits and why traditional food shopping is ultimately superior.

To begin with, some people prefer to shop food in supermarkets because they have their own reasons. One particular reason is that food stores undergo a quality check regularly before deploying it to people so, people are choosing to buy food in supermarket. For example, if a product is fake or does not meet quality standards, they can sue them. Therefore, people choose buying food in physical stores.

On the other hand, some people will go with online food because it has its own benefits. One of the major reason is that they can order food from home by using mobile phone or laptop. For instance, if someone is not interested in going out or busy with their own work they have this facility to shop from home with ease.Being able to shop online saves busy people the unnecessary hassle of having to visit a store.

Finally, with the introduction to online food shopping, traditional routines are being challenged in many ways. Some people prefer going to buy food in supermarket while other people going with a new way that is online food shopping. In my opinion, visiting supermarket offers a better experience of food shopping."
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Shopping for food
I often go shopping at the weekend. Saturdays and Sundays are perfect days for shopping. All shops work on these days. I make up a shopping list and write down the products I’m going to buy. I think a shopping list is very convenient because I know what I want to buy and I don’t make any silly mistake. I take my money, a credit card, because you can pay by credit card in most places. I can go to a department store where I can do the shopping under one roof. But I can also go to supermarket. At first, I drop in at the greengrocer’s where I can buy vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers, cabbages, carrots, oranges, apples, pears, tangerines, bananas. I am always very careful when I buy vegetables and fruit. I want them to be fresh. Then I go to the butcher’s. There I can buy pork, beef, mutton, chicken, sausage. It depends on what I’m going to cook at home. The bakery is the next on my way. Sometimes I call at the bakery to buy buns, bread or biscuits there. It’s common knowledge that dairy products are very useful for our health, so I always visit the dairy department to buy milk, cheese, yoghurt and kefir. I finish my shopping by calling at the grocer’s to buy noodles, spaghetti, olive oil, salt and sugar. Of course, I can go to the market. The prices are much cheaper there. The salespeople are always very polite. They try to help me to find what I need. You can also compare prices. If things are not heavy, I continue my shopping, but if I have lots of bags, I give up shopping and do it next day."

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Grocery shopping can be done by going to supermarkets physically or by ordering online. Although ordering groceries online is a recent trend, some people still prefer the traditional way of buying by visiting supermarkets in person. This essay will discuss why purchasing food items by visiting supermarkets is better than ordering those online.

Nowadays people find it relaxing to shop food online rather than putting laborsome effort to do the same. The process of buying food online is effortless because people can visit a website, browse through the categories, select the items they want to purchase, pay via online payment system, and have their groceries delivered at their doorstep. For instance, chaldal.com is delivering fresh groceries to people of Dhaka city within 1 hour after the order placement. Hence, shopping food from an online store is very much convenient for people with a hectic schedule.

But not everyone likes to trust unfamiliar people to select fresh groceries for them. Instead, they prefer to check piles of fresh vegetables in the supermarket to choose the freshest one. For example, a recent article revealed that most supermarkets prefer to deliver poor quality items for their online customers and leave their best quality items on display for the visiting customers. Hence, visiting supermarkets assists people to buy the freshest groceries than receiving the low-quality ones via online order.

Online food shopping is challenging the traditional way of buying food items. This essay discussed why online shopping is gaining popularity among people but why shopping at the supermarket is helping people buy fresh food. In my opinion, food shopping from supermarket offers better reliability to online shopping."

As I created the shopping list which consisted of breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner, according to the USDA, the cost of food was to be budgeted at $150.50 for thrifty plan and $197.90 for low cost plan. The prices for the items on my shopping list were from Stop and Shop. Though creating a healthy meal for the family is difficult, it involves planning and spending wise decisions in order to accommodate with the budget. Once the goal of the budget has been made, the difficult task comes when creating meals for a certain period of time.

Many individuals can reheat the food if there is any or eat a lot of salads and sandwiches since it is inexpensive. Also cup noodles are very cheap, however, it is unhealthy due to the large amount of sodium it contains. I believe healthy meals tend to get expensive, but if a family wants to stay in a budget that means they have to buy frozen foods and a lot of canned soups which sometimes does not have the proper nutrients a body needs therefore it is not considered a healthy diet. Another way to stay within the budget is to use the same foods, but for different lunches. For example, potato soup or pot roast can be used as different dishes and side dishes. There are a variety of foods that can create a balanced nutrition. Many stores offer coupons, and membership cards which offer many discounts, so this is a way families can benefit on huge "
,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"When I was a very young girl around the age of six or seven, I enjoyed going grocery shopping with my mother. Going to the grocery store was considered a major outing to me. In my eyes, the grocery store was a place in which adventures could happen. I was always amazed at the seemingly endless rows of groceries and household items inside the chain grocery stores we went to on our outings. Candy even has an entire store aisle devoted to its sale! Going to the grocery store was always a pleasure to me when I was a kid.
When my mom and I went into the store, the automatic doors of the entrance greatly amused me. These doors seemed like an invention from outer space when I was little. I would sometimes find where the sensor located a person, and I would make the door reopen each time it would swing shut.
The first place my mom always went to was the fruits and vegetables area. The color of all the fruits and vegetables were eye candy for me. I was overwhelmed; kiwis, bananas, oranges, tomatoes, cucumbers, and others were all in one area of the store. I loved when my mother would ask me to pick out the ripe fruit. I would feel for the springy, smooth flesh of a ripe tomato or the soft, fuzzy skin of peaches. When handling this food, it was hard for me to resist having a bite out of these succulent fruits. I would have loved to take a bite of the peaches and taste the juicy, sweet, but tart, fruit.
Another desire that children have while in the grocery store is to have fresh cookies from the bakery. My mom tried not to bring me along if I was hungry, but sometimes this was
unavoidable. I would beg and plead with her until she bought me a warm and gooey M&M chocolate chip cookie. These were my favorites! I would bite down on this treat, and the chocolate immediately turned into liquid inside of my mouth. After I was fed, my mom and I would make our way down the aisles to shop for the day.
Some days, the grocery store would be packed with people. Aisles would transform into traffic jams of people and shopping carts, and checkout lanes would be ten people deep and counting. Sunday afternoons were like this. I loved to see the people around me dressed in their Sunday best. My favorite was to see little old women with colorful hats covering their silver hair. These hats came in all shapes and sizes, but each would have a huge bow on it.
Finally, my mom and I headed toward the checkout lanes. I always rushed ahead of her to try to find a lane with only a few people. Seldom did this work because I could not get too far away from her. The last thing that happens at the end of a shopping trip is the checkout. I hated this part the most because of the monotonous, shrill beep the scanner makes as it is reading an item's barcode. This sound would keep ringing in my ears until we got back to our car.
After unloading our groceries into the car, my mom and I would go home. Being in the car would calm me down from all the excitement we had just witnessed. I would just think about my next trip to the grocery store and what kind of adventure could be had the next time.

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Advancement in technology has made it possible to shop online. A number of people like to purchase food from nearby supermarkets and local vendors. On the other hand, a group of people prefer to shop food from online stores. I would like to discuss both practices in this essay.

To begin with, online shopping for food has become common in busy cities because it satisfies the lifestyle needs of the people and eliminates the need to travel long distances to supermarkets in heavy traffic. Moreover, when people shop online they have the option of comparing prices and this enables them to get the best deal. Apart from that, prices of online food are much cheaper than prices in supermarket because they do not require a large storage space and staff for maintenance.  For instance, the number of supermarkets closing their operations has increased because of the competitive prices and discounts offered by the online stores.

However, the traditional way of purchasing food from local vendors or supermarkets is still popular among others. This has some pros like an opportunity to taste different kinds of food before purchasing them and ensuring the quality of the product. Also, when we buy from a physical store we can even taste the aroma of the food and decide whether we want to buy or not. The major drawback of shopping at supermarkets is that it is a time consuming and tedious task to find the products.

In conclusion, buying food online is more advantageous than buying it from supermarkets because it saves consumers both time and money

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Many individuals are finding it hard to keep food on the table. The price of the regular household bills, gas, and necessities are increasing. The price of food is getting higher as well. The following are some tips to help people, who are having a hard time, spend less money on their grocery bills. 

Set a budget

Set up a household food budget and don’t go over that set amount of money. You probably have an idea what the cost of most of the food you buy usually is. Keep the prices in mind when you make the budget. 

Make a list

Before you go shopping take an inventory of the food items that you have at home and the things that you will need. Make a list of items that you will need to pick up at the grocery store. Leaving a small notebook in…show more content…
A lot of times you can find some pretty good deals on the food items that you use. If you find a really good deal, you may want to pick up a few of the item. That way you won’t have to buy it the next time the price is up. Canned goods last for a while and a lot of other foods can be frozen. 

Buy store brand

Buying store brand foods can save you a lot of money. A lot of times, the store brand item tastes just as good as the food that has the brand name does. Store brand foods are less expensive. I know that a lot of people don’t think they will like the store brand, but sometimes it’s worth trying. Talking to friends and family to see what brands of food they use may be helpful while making the decision on whether or not to try a store brand item. You will probably be surprised on the amount of people that you know that use the less expensive item.

Warehouse club shopping

A warehouse club card can usually be purchased for $50 or less a year. Before becoming a member, think about the foods you use most often. If the warehouse club has good prices on a lot of the food items you use, it may be worth getting the membership. Some households use a lot of cheese, milk, eggs, tortilla chips, baking goods, and other items that could be bought in bulk instead of on a weekly basis. The warehouse prices are probably cheaper in the long run and you will most likely get more of the product for the money.

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Like many girls, I absolutely love clothes shopping! But, as a student, I don’t have a lot of money to keep up with the latest fashion trends. 

Especially when it comes to vintage clothes, which are in fashion at the moment - I can’t afford many things in vintage shops. I like to look on eBay, but I find it difficult to buy clothes online because they don’t always fit well when they arrive. I like to always try on clothes in the shop before I buy them - it makes each shopping trip much more fun!

In England, we have shops called ‘charity shops’, where people donate their old clothes, shoes, books, CDs, DVDs, and children's toys and games. In America, they are called ‘thrift shops’ - which you may know from Macklemore’s hit song! I love these shops, because you can often find a bargain - brand new clothes with the tags still on them, or real vintage items which haven’t got a big price tag!

The only downside to charity shopping is that you have to search through everything in the shop, which can take a lot of time. Also, sometimes it is disappointing - I have searched for hours before and not found a single thing to buy! But I find this with big department stores in shopping centres too, so perhaps it is just occasional bad luck! The majority of the time, however, I have found some bargains, and saved lots of money! In the past, I have found lovely handbags, new shoes, hardly-worn clothes, and some fantastic second-hand books and DVDs at a fraction of the price that you’d find in a normal shop. And the best part about charity shopping is that the money goes to a good cause! "

I have come to my decision of opening up a clothing store. Why? The reason is because shoes is not really a big thing hear because everybody carries pretty much the same brand, and women are way to picky when it comes shoes, so I wouldn't even try. There are about 16 shoe places in this mall. Way to much competition. I also looked at a toy store, but they only really make money during the holidays. There are only 3 in the mall. But for that reason there are only 3. Another business I was looking at was maybe opening up a restaurant in the mall, in the food court. But there is like 15 different places to eat here. Again way to much competition. There is a lot of competition for any type of store. But, that's when I was like there is a lot of competition for a clothing store, but not everybody carries the same type of clothes. 
             The type of store that I have decided upon is a clothing store. There is about 17 stores in the mall that have to deal with clothing in way or another. But none of these stores offer 3 major brands. The brands are express, gap, and Abercrombie and finch. I will offer these brands. I know hundreds of people who where this clothing. These are some of my favorite brands. I have to drive about 45 minutes away from my house to the Valencia mall just to be able to purchase these brands. That's kind of ridiculous. At the same time very annoying. There is hundreds of people who do this where I live. Now when I open this store and begin to start selling these brands, about 75 % of the people are going to come shopping at my store because they now have the product that they love about 5-15 minutes away from them, instead of having there product 45min-1hr.

,,,,,shopping,,,,,,,,,"Marks & Spencer has over 11% of British clothing and footwear market, the nearest competitor of the firm in the clothing retailer market is Next which has a market share of 7%, and the second competitor is Zara that controls less than one percent of the market. Even those figure showed that Marks & Spencer held great position for itself in the market; however, it was the fifth consecutive quarter that it has lost ground in womenswear (The Economist 2012). The sale of clothing of the firms has been fell 6.8% between April and June in 2012 compared with the same period the year before 2012 (M&S Annual Report 2012). The declines in the past years were because firstly Marks & Spencer had previously focusing on quality of its products and offering value of money. However, the company did not expect the fickleness of the customer trends and change in fashion (Oliver, 2005); and secondly is the global recession. There will have detail description of offline and online retail environment for Marks & Spencer clothing department and its competitors. 

2.1.1 Online retail marketplace 
With the developing of Internet and high technology products, customer no need to go to a shop to buy goods, they can search through their computer, laptop, smart phone and other devices. In this modern society, customers could find, purchase and get anything without leaving their home. Because of the global recession, customers trend to buy clothes that more valuable than before and they have spent less since the recession began (Mintel Report 2010), which means it is easier for them to search online rather than go out to find one piece of cloth shop by shop. This also saves time and money for the customers. Thus, all the competitors of Marks & Spencer that mentioned above were developing their online retailer market to attract more new customers as well as keep their exist customers.

Marks & Spencer provided full details of their clothing; include price, material, colour and size of their clothing. In order to help customer while purchase the cloth, they also provide a guide of size for customer, to help them make decision. During this circumstance, customer only need open the website of the firm and browse the type of clothes that they would like to purchase and find the one they believe suits best and just purchase it online as it will be delivery to the address in few days. 

Each and most every clothing retail companies like Marks & Spencer, Next, Zara and etc. are offering their clothing on their websites and some of them deliver the clothing to customers for free. Many of them have newsletter for their exits customers, it gives customer to check out the information of the firm and discount information as well; and get the consumers a chance to compare between the different brand for price and material. The newsletter also gives consumers the opportunity to chasing fashion, as mentioned before. Marks & Spencer would like to provide the most convenient shopping experience for their customers, form their multi-channel ways (M&S Annual Report 2012). 

2.1.2 Offline retail marketplace 
Clothing is a thing that is easily available both online and offline, people can go to store to find out many different clothing; by style, price and material; and compare them with others as most of the competitors of Marks & Spencer are hold store in high street in cities. For Marks & Spencer, there were 731 store in UK and 387 stores internationally, those figures were increased compare with 2011 (M&S Annual Report 2012). Hence, it could say that there is still a marketplace for offline clothing retail, the reasons of that situation happened are because, firstly, even people are trending to shopping online more"
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"Some people think one should stay all their life in the same job, whereas others advocate changing jobs from time to time. 

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

People tend to differ when it comes to the opinion whether one should change job frequently. On the one hand, many people think one should keep doing the same job all throughout the life where as other advise that is not the way to go. The merits of both the arguments will be analysed before a conclusion is provided.

Firstly, there are immense benefits that professionals enjoy sticking to a same job. But the most obvious ones are security and enhanced expertise in a specific domain that they gain during their tenure in the workplace. For example, a civil engineer who is designing the architecture of bridge for years knows all the nitty-gritty details of the factors for building a robust bridge. Because of his vast experience, his company will also be interested to retain him as the same level of competency cannot be expected from a newcomer. This supports the argument that continuing the same job over years has several positive facets.

However, many other people argue in favour of changing jobs recurrently. The main reason being when individuals work in several jobs they usually add more skills to their portfolio and this definitely improves their employability. For instance, when a wildlife photographer changes his job and joins an advertising agency, not only his skills get enhanced, he is also considered as more dynamic and versatile. Additionally, spending too long in a job also make people feel monotonous. This makes clear why the idea of shifting jobs is suggested.

After looking at these two opposing points of view, it is felt that changing jobs every once in a while is of more benefit. However, it is recommended that one should judge the situation prior to make a decision."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"According to Hull (1997), the modern working environment is challenging, and this raises a lot of questions about the dynamics in work and employment. In order to enhance the functioning of the work environment, it is critical to explore issues that surround the modern working environment.
The dynamics of work and employment involve issues of gender, legal issues, skills, and the changing demands of technology among a series of other issues in the country.

In this paper, It is argued that the changing needs of work and employment are factors that must be explored in order to enhance better working relations within the modern working environment. Employers and employees, as well as organizations and the labour industry must be ready to confront the realities of the complexity of work and employment.

The dynamics at work and employment in the modern working environment are also explored in this paper. Modern working environment is taken to be the collective organizational expanse in the midst of the organizational dynamics of work and employment that are being witnessed in the contemporary economy.

Through an exploration of literature, the paper brings out the issues that confront working and employment in the contemporary economy."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"Skills in work and employment

There are a lot of changes in the contemporary economy. These changes need to be captured in order to better the functioning of modern organizations. It is argued that the question of skills is critical in work and employment.

According to Grugulis and Lloyd (2010), the question of skills and how these skills are distributed across the labour industry determines the value of the work environment and its contribution to organizational performance. The qualification of employees change with the changing demands in different industries in the economy. This is the main challenge in the management of skills.

The question of skills in the workplace in not a new issue since it is an issue that has come out in the labour theory (Payne 2000). The modern work environment requires diversity of skills in order to deal with the multiple complexities of work and employment (Junor 2010).

The issue of skills at work and employment has moved away from the simple question of asking and specifying the roles of employees in the workplace to quite complex questions of whether the current nature of labourers in the modern labour industry can provide employees who are conversant with the challenges and needs of the contemporary work environment.

What comes out from the findings is that there is a widening gap between the demand for skills and the rate at which the global labour industry can supply the required labour skills to meet the demands of the modern working environment (Salomon and Centre for Literacy 2009).

There is need for employees to diversify their skills in this era of industrialization, and the need to make use of the few available resources to bring about success and advancement of business and other institutions within the modern economy (United States, United States & United States 2000).

This raises the question of the demand for knowledge in the economy since knowledge is the sole source of skills in the society (Junor 2010). The industrialized economies in the world have an upper hand when it comes to the balance of skills and knowledge in work and employment.

The current state of the global labour market shows a cultivation of an active policy environment within the labour market. One of the key policy areas is skills in the economy (Grugulis and Lloyd 2010).

Barrett and O’Connell (2001) argued that training is the main way through which employees can get updated with the diverse skills that are required to manage functions in the prevailing work environment that is proving to be quite competitive and demanding."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"Technology advancement and adoption in the economy, and the question of work and employment

Technology is seen as a fundamental ingredient to economic development. The question of technology adoption in the work environment has come into the picture with the advancement in information and communication technology, and the strong feeling of how information and communication technology can advance the work environment (Bharati and Chaudhury 2006).

The issue of technology development has inseparable links with the issue of skills. Employees are being pressed to gain technological skills in order to enhance administration and management through technology. Technology is seen as a great asset in the work environment.

The main aim of technology in organizational contexts is to enhance speed and efficiency in the discharge of organizational tasks by organizational employees. It is critical to observe that there are diverse perspectives on the issue of technology development and the issue of work and employment in the contemporary work environment (Jenkins 2008).

While most people see technology as a vital tool for efficiency and effectiveness in production, other people blame the advancement in technology as a source of problems in the labour industry. However, it has emerged strongly that technology has been used by a substantial number of companies as a tool for dealing with the problems of the rising costs of labour in the world.

As the demand for technology keeps rising, the question that ought to be explored is whether technology is contributing evenly to economic development, considering the concerns of technology adoption in the global labour industry (Kleynhans 2006). The United Kingdom is one of the benchmark countries in terms of technology adoption in improving efficiency and effectiveness in the work environment.

Most analysts in the labour industry argue that the best way to embrace technology in the modern economy is through embracing the training of employees in line with the emerging technologies so that they can be effectively deployed in organizational advancement.

However, there are a number of implications for training employees. Training can be an all expensive affair for most organizations, especially when there is a low level of technology adoption among the employees. Unlike the developing countries, there is a higher rate of technology adoption in the UK. This means that the costs of training employees on technology adoption will be slightly lower (Barrett and O’Connell 2001)."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"The question of gender in work and employment

Jeans (2011) observed that the subject of gender studies in the labour industry began even before the industrial revolution in Western Europe. The issue of gender mainstreaming has become vocal in the modern labour industry. In the recent times, this debate has gained momentum courtesy of the growth of feminist movements across the world.
The issue of equal treatment in employment is no longer just treated as an advancement of activism or women’s representation in employment, but also a legislative issue that is forcing a number of legislative reforms in order to capture it.

Women have often been segregated in employment, with several reasons being given explaining why the rate of women absorption in the industry is still low compared to the number of men who are absorbed in the labour industry.

It should come out clearly that the tasks of men and women in diverse work environments vary. However, this can no longer be used as a basis upon which women are locked out of the active labour industry. Women are taking up the challenge and are pursuing skills that are critical to placing them in the labour industry.

According to Tuchtfeldt (2008), modern managers are increasingly put under pressure by human rights bodies to ensure that they strike a balance in gender representation in their organizations. However, the variation in the level of skills between men and women remains to be a challenge in attaining a balance between women and men in the workplace (Sealy and Doherty 2012).

The question that ought to be asked is whether the gender balance of equal representation can be truly attained given the argument that there is no balance at the rate of learning and skill attainment between men and women. This remains a debatable issue as organizations keep inventing means of empowering women so that they can match the competition from men for employment opportunities.

Women have been subjected to gender-based violence at the workplace. This also forms art of the ongoing legislative processes on how to strike a balance in human resource to eliminate all odds of gender victimization at the workplace, thereby allowing women to climb the ladders in the corporate world (Sealy and Doherty 2012).

The recent corporate world has seen a resurgence of women who are proving to equal men in top managerial positions (Jeanes 2011). Apart from the dispute between genders in employment, empirical studies are also pointing to the fact the changing roles of gender in diverse work environments. It has emerged that there are a substantial number of jobs than are reserved for women than are men (Scholarios and Taylor 2011)."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"Rationalization in work and employment

Hales (2000) observed that the ideal of rationalizing the work environment is being advanced by liberals in the field of organizational management.

When looked at in terms of corporate management, rationalization is taken as the step of scrutinizing and selecting of corporate leaders and employees who can be able to think of the organization and develop work practices that can help the organization to sail through the complexities of the modern economy.

Corporate organizations no longer fill work positions by basing on the principles of personnel management, but they do so by embracing the principles of modern human resource management. In modern human resource management, employees have to steer the organization towards achieving both the short-term and the long-term objectives. Even the job positions in organizations are crafted in a strategic manner.

This means that rationalization goes further than just the recruitment of employees. Rationalization goes into the definition and crafting and description of job positions in organizations. Therefore, modern employees need to have knowledge and be competitive in terms of applying knowledge in finding growth solutions to the organization (Noon 2010)."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"There are a substantial number of developments in work and employment in the current global economy. The current global economy faces a lot of challenges that bring about complexities, thus necessitating the changes in work and employment to address the complexities. In the paper, four main issues that denote changes in work and employment have come out.

These are the issue of demand for skills in the workplace, technology adoption in organizations, the question of gender in work and employment, and rationalization in work and employment in modern corporate organizations. Exploration of these issues has pointed to the fact that the complexity in work and employment in the globalised economy cannot be addressed by focusing on a single issue."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"Work is the best way to reduce poverty – yet more than one billion people have no job or are underemployed. In the fight against rising unemployment, new approaches and policy ideas are needed, explains David Robalino, a labour market expert at the World Bank.

We often think of a job as a source of income for workers. But jobs represent much more for society and individuals. Countries grow, for instance, when more people work, when each job in the economy becomes more productive, and when people move from low to higher productivity jobs. A good portion of the reduction in poverty that we have seen worldwide can be explained by an increase in the labour income of the poor, their main source of income. Jobs also contribute to the accumulation of human capital and promote social stability. A young person who is employed learns on the job, gains experience, makes other workers in the economy more productive and is less likely to engage in risky or criminal behaviour. Women who work also tend to invest more in the human capital of their children. Ultimately, our jobs give us a sense of identity, affect our level of wellbeing and determine whether we feel self-fulfilled or alienated, whether we are likely to start or join a revolution, and whether or not we vote and for whom.
And yet, as important as jobs are, we are failing to avert a global crisis possibly as consequential as climate change. Indeed, a world in the not too distant future in which the majority of people do not work or are underemployed is now a real possibility. It is unlikely, however, to be a world in which people are happier, enjoying more leisure and time with their friends and families thanks to machines that take care of most tasks and generous government benefits (financed by the owners of the machines). At least at first, it could be a world of high inequality, social instability, widespread mental health problems, environmental degradation, and massive movements of people across borders.
‘Differences in job opportunities and earnings within and across countries are becoming more and more pronounced.’
Today there are roughly 7.5 billion human beings on planet Earth, 4.5 billion of whom are old enough but not too old to work. Of this number, 1.2 billion are inactive; they are not attending school, working, or looking for a job. According to World Bank calculations, 200 million of those classified as active are actually unemployed and 2 billion are underemployed. They are working just a few hours a week, are self-employed as subsistence farmers or in small household enterprises with very low productivity, selling products in tiny local markets. In Africa and South Asia, over 75 per cent of these workers do not produce or earn enough to feed their families; they are poor. In fact, the differences in job opportunities and earnings within and across countries are becoming more and more pronounced. This is creating social dislocation and is leading to massive movements of people. There are currently over 260 million international migrants (up from 170 million in 2000) and many millions of refugees. They are willing to cross borders and oceans, but receiving countries or regions are not always ready for them. Those who survive the journey often face destitution, abuse or exploitation."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"NEW TECHNOLOGIES WILL CONTINUE TO DISPLACE JOBS

Demographics and technological change will complicate things further. In countries in Africa and South Asia with young populations, there will be many new entrants to the labour market. It is estimated that middle and low-income countries will need to create 530 million jobs by 2030 to absorb them, yet at the current pace they may create only 400 million. At the same time, in high-income countries where populations are getting older, the challenge is to get people to work for longer in order to keep afloat strained social security systems. This is not easy to do, particularly in the face of fast technological change. New technologies are displacing – and will continue to displace – jobs not only on the factory floor but also in the services sector. From accountants and travel agents to paralegals and soon drivers. Granted, new technologies also open up opportunities to create new products and services and therefore new jobs. But it is not easy for those who had the old jobs to take on the new ones; the skills and competencies are very different. More than that, new jobs are likely to be created in very different sectors and in faraway regions.  

We economists got things wrong. We had too much faith in the idea that, as long as countries put in place the ‘right’ business environment – meaning the right macro and regulatory policies – private investments would increase, resources would flow to the most productive sectors and regions, economies would grow and jobs would follow. To address the jobs challenge, it was therefore thought that countries needed to promote macroeconomic stability, simplify business regulations, promote investments in infrastructure and education, and improve governance. But as important as these policies are, they are insufficient."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"GROWTH DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY MEAN NEW JOBS

First, even with stability and the right business environment, private investments do not happen on the scale needed if there is not enough entrepreneurial capacity, which is often the case in developing countries. More importantly, in situations in which countries need to achieve social objectives through employment, it is unlikely that private entrepreneurs or investors alone can generate the right number and distribution of jobs. This is what we have seen even in countries such as Georgia and Chile, which have been prolific with the adoption of structural reforms. The data shows, in fact, that many growth episodes across countries have taken place with little to show in terms of job creation or without addressing issues related to poverty, the informal sector, youth unemployment and low female labour force participation. The sectors and regions in which investments are made – usually urban areas with the right infrastructure – are not necessarily where vulnerable workers live. Moreover, they are not usually the sectors that demand the skills they have. 

So what should we do? We need to start thinking about jobs the way we think about carbon emissions. We know that carbon emissions contribute to global warming and are therefore bad for society. We also know that the private sector is not really paying attention to the social costs of the emissions it generates as a result of its investments and production decisions. This is why governments try to tax carbon emissions and/or subsidise the development of technologies that reduce emissions. With jobs, we need to do something similar. Objectively speaking, the function of the private sector is not to create jobs or address the social problems that emerge because of a lack of good jobs. Entrepreneurs, investors and managers do great things for society, but what drives them in most cases are financial returns, not jobs. Because they do not take into account the social consequences that their investments and production decisions have on jobs, governments need to intervene by subsidising the creation of certain jobs and taxing the destruction of others.

This is not referring to wage subsidies. Many countries have adopted programmes that try to reduce the cost of labour – for instance, by reducing social security contributions. Tunisia, for example, did so after the revolution, as have many other countries, including Chile, Jordan, and South Africa, as part of initiatives to promote youth employment. These programmes, however, have had a limited impact. This is in part because, when there is not enough productive capacity, adding labour, even if it is free, is not profitable.

Instead I am referring to programmes that subsidise private investments contingent on job creation or improvements in the quality of jobs for specific population groups in targeted regions. In a way, these programmes would resemble the ‘industrial policies’ successfully adopted by countries in East Asia. South Korea, for instance, introduced policies to develop technological capabilities, promote exports and build the domestic capacity to manufacture a range of intermediate goods such as plastics and steel. Support for particular industries and imports of the necessary foreign technology took several forms including subsidised capital, public investments in education (particularly engineering and science) and public infrastructure to facilitate technological transfers.
The focus then was on economic growth, but similar strategies can apply to jobs. The idea is not to pick winners but, instead, to recognise that certain private investments which are good for jobs might not take place because private rates of return are not high enough. For instance, investments in agriculture and agribusinesses in lagging, low-income or conflict regions that would create jobs for the poor or improve the quality of their current jobs might not materialise because investors can achieve higher returns elsewhere – for instance, in the stock market. Yet, due to jobs externalities, the social rate of return on investments in the agricultural sector can be quite high. In these cases, governments need to increase private rates of return on investments through direct or indirect subsidies. These can take the form of matching grants for private investments, public investments in basic infrastructure and social services, support for the development of value chains or technical assistance for start-ups or small and medium-sized enterprises.
‘We had too much faith in the idea that, as long as countries put in place the ‘right’ business environment, private investments would increase.’"
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"THE PROPOSAL: A FUND FOR MORE JOBS

Taxing job destruction is also not as crazy as it sounds. Many countries do it implicitly through labour regulations that restrict dismissals and require the payment of severance to workers who lose their jobs. But current policies discourage innovation, can harm the competitiveness of firms and eventually reduce job creation without necessarily offering good protection to workers. The proposal, instead, is to let firms manage their human resources as needed, and then replace severance pay (paid by employers) with unemployment insurance (paid by the government) and introduce a modest, explicit dismissal tax. The revenue generated by this tax would flow into a fund that could be used to finance active programmes that help workers connect to jobs or move from low to high-quality jobs. 

Thus, as new technologies change the demand for different types of skills, an infrastructure would be in place to retrain workers and facilitate transitions to new jobs. Almost all countries have these programmes, which include different types of training, counselling, intermediation, job search assistance and mobility premiums. Unfortunately, only one third of the programmes that have been rigorously evaluated have had a positive impact. We need to improve the design of these programmes by adopting modern identification and statistical profiling systems to assess the main constraints facing beneficiaries, introducing rigorous monitoring and evaluations systems, and outsourcing the provision of an integrated package of services to providers (public and private) that are paid on the basis of results.
‘We need to start thinking about jobs the way we think about carbon emissions. Because entrepreneurs do not take into account the social consequences that their investments have on jobs, governments need to intervene with subsidies and taxes.’
Countries like South Korea, Malaysia, Colombia, Chile and more recently Tunisia are moving in this direction. To expand the coverage of these programmes, particularly to rural areas and vulnerable population groups, it is also necessary to rethink financing mechanisms. Thus far, programmes have been mainly financed through general revenues. However, many of the beneficiaries could finance at least part of the cost. For instance, a recent survey of young people in Nairobi, Kenya, showed that they would be willing to pay up to 50 per cent of the costs incurred. 
Clearly, none of the reforms discussed above are easy to implement, and not all countries have the fiscal space to do so overnight. International organisations and bilateral donors will have an important role to play in facilitating reforms. Firstly, by trying as much as possible, to come up with a unified policy framework. Different organisations often have very different diagnostics and offer very different policy recommendations, which is not particularly helpful for the country. Secondly, by mobilising the necessary technical expertise, including data collection, monitoring and evaluation systems. And thirdly, by adjusting their portfolio of lending, investments and grant operations. Today a considerable amount of resources are allocated to activities and projects which are supposed to focus on jobs but in practice do not. Developing new instruments and models to support lending and investments for jobs is key. Finally, as in the case of the East Asian Tigers, it is imperative that governments get their act together. A leaner and better prepared civil service can go a long way to improving policy-making and the allocation of public expenditure, in consultation with social partners."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"in 2003, thanks to Michael Lewis and his best seller Moneyball, the general manager of the Oakland A’s, Billy Beane, became a star. The previous year, Beane had turned his back on his scouts and had instead entrusted player-acquisition decisions to mathematical models developed by a young, Harvard-trained statistical wizard on his staff. What happened next has become baseball lore. The A’s, a small-market team with a paltry budget, ripped off the longest winning streak in American League history and rolled up 103 wins for the season. Only the mighty Yankees, who had spent three times as much on player salaries, won as many games. The team’s success, in turn, launched a revolution. In the years that followed, team after team began to use detailed predictive models to assess players’ potential and monetary value, and the early adopters, by and large, gained a measurable competitive edge over their more hidebound peers."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"That’s the story as most of us know it. But it is incomplete. What would seem at first glance to be nothing but a memorable tale about baseball may turn out to be the opening chapter of a much larger story about jobs. Predictive statistical analysis, harnessed to big data, appears poised to alter the way millions of people are hired and assessed.

Yes, unavoidably, big data. As a piece of business jargon, and even more so as an invocation of coming disruption, the term has quickly grown tiresome. But there is no denying the vast increase in the range and depth of information that’s routinely captured about how we behave, and the new kinds of analysis that this enables. By one estimate, more than 98 percent of the world’s information is now stored digitally, and the volume of that data has quadrupled since 2007. Ordinary people at work and at home generate much of this data, by sending e-mails, browsing the Internet, using social media, working on crowd-sourced projects, and more—and in doing so they have unwittingly helped launch a grand new societal project. “We are in the midst of a great infrastructure project that in some ways rivals those of the past, from Roman aqueducts to the Enlightenment’s Encyclopédie,” write Viktor Mayer-Schönberger and Kenneth Cukier in their recent book, Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think. “The project is datafication. Like those other infrastructural advances, it will bring about fundamental changes to society.”"
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"Some of the changes are well known, and already upon us. Algorithms that predict stock-price movements have transformed Wall Street. Algorithms that chomp through our Web histories have transformed marketing. Until quite recently, however, few people seemed to believe this data-driven approach might apply broadly to the labor market.

But it now does. According to John Hausknecht, a professor at Cornell’s school of industrial and labor relations, in recent years the economy has witnessed a “huge surge in demand for workforce-analytics roles.” Hausknecht’s own program is rapidly revising its curriculum to keep pace. You can now find dedicated analytics teams in the human-resources departments of not only huge corporations such as Google, HP, Intel, General Motors, and Procter & Gamble, to name just a few, but also companies like McKee Foods, the Tennessee-based maker of Little Debbie snack cakes. Even Billy Beane is getting into the game. Last year he appeared at a large conference for corporate HR executives in Austin, Texas, where he reportedly stole the show with a talk titled “The Moneyball Approach to Talent Management.” Ever since, that headline, with minor modifications, has been plastered all over the HR trade press.

The application of predictive analytics to people’s careers—an emerging field sometimes called “people analytics”—is enormously challenging, not to mention ethically fraught. And it can’t help but feel a little creepy. It requires the creation of a vastly larger box score of human performance than one would ever encounter in the sports pages, or that has ever been dreamed up before. To some degree, the endeavor touches on the deepest of human mysteries: how we grow, whether we flourish, what we become. Most companies are just beginning to explore the possibilities. But make no mistake: during the next five to 10 years, new models will be created, and new experiments run, on a very large scale. Will this be a good development or a bad one—for the economy, for the shapes of our careers, for our spirit and self-worth? Earlier this year, I decided to find out."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"ever since we’ve had companies, we’ve had managers trying to figure out which people are best suited to working for them. The techniques have varied considerably. Near the turn of the 20th century, one manufacturer in Philadelphia made hiring decisions by having its foremen stand in front of the factory and toss apples into the surrounding scrum of job-seekers. Those quick enough to catch the apples and strong enough to keep them were put to work.

In those same times, a different (and less bloody) Darwinian process governed the selection of executives. Whole industries were being consolidated by rising giants like U.S. Steel, DuPont, and GM. Weak competitors were simply steamrolled, but the stronger ones were bought up, and their founders typically were offered high-level jobs within the behemoth. The approach worked pretty well. As Peter Cappelli, a professor at the Wharton School, has written, “Nothing in the science of prediction and selection beats observing actual performance in an equivalent role.”"
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"In the course of working my way through school, I have taken many jobs I would rather forget. I have spent nine hours a day lifting heavy automobile and truck batteries off the end of an assembly belt. I have risked the loss of eyes and fingers working a punch press in a textile factory. I have served as a ward aide in a mental hospital, helping care for brain-damaged men who would break into violent fits at unexpected moments. But none of these jobs was as dreadful as my job in an apple plant. The work was physically hard; the pay was poor; and, most of all, the working conditions were dismal.

First supporting paragraph

First of all, the job made enormous demands on my strength and energy. For ten hours a night, I took cartons that rolled down a metal track and stacked them onto wooden skids in a tractor-trailer. Each carton contained twelve heavy cans or bottles of apple juice. A carton shot down the track about every fifteen seconds. I once figured out that I was lifting an average of twelve tons of apple juice every night. When a truck was almost filled, I or my partner had to drag fourteen bulky wooden skids into the empty trailer nearby and then set up added sections of the heavy metal track so that we could start routing cartons to the back of the empty van. While one of us did that, the other performed the stacking work of two men.

Second supporting paragraph

I would not have minded the difficulty of the work so much if the pay had not been so poor. I was paid the minimum wage of that time, two dollars an hour, plus the minimum of a nickel extra for working the night shift. Because of the low salary, I felt compelled to get as much overtime pay as possible. Everything over eight hours a night was time-and-a-half, so I typically worked twelve hours a night. On Friday I would sometimes work straight through until Saturday at noon -- eighteen hours. I averaged over sixty hours a week but did not take home much more than one hundred dollars.

Third supporting paragraph

But even more than the low pay, what upset me about my apple plant job was the working conditions. Our humorless supervisor cared only about his production record for each night and tried to keep the assembly line moving at a breakneck pace. During work I was limited to two ten-minute breaks and an unpaid half hour for lunch. Most of my time was spent outside on the truck loading dock in near-zero-degree temperatures. The steel floors of the trucks were like ice; the quickly penetrating cold made my feet feel like stone. I had no shared interests with the man I loaded cartons with, and so I had to work without job companionship. And after the production line shut down and most people left, I had to spend two hours alone scrubbing clean the apple vats, which were coated with a sticky residue.

Concluding paragraph

I stayed on the job for five months, hating all the while the difficulty of the work, the poor money, and the conditions under which I worked. By the time I quit, I was determined never to do such degrading work again."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"As we celebrate the centennial of the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote, we should also celebrate the major strides women have made in the labor market. Their entry into paid work has been a major factor in America’s prosperity over the past century and a quarter.


Despite this progress, evidence suggests that many women remain unable to achieve their goals. The gap in earnings between women and men, although smaller than it was years ago, is still significant; women continue to be underrepresented in certain industries and occupations; and too many women struggle to combine aspirations for work and family. Further advancement has been hampered by barriers to equal opportunity and workplace rules and norms that fail to support a reasonable work-life balance. If these obstacles persist, we will squander the potential of many of our citizens and incur a substantial loss to the productive capacity of our economy at a time when the aging of the population and weak productivity growth are already weighing on economic growth.

A historical perspective on women in the labor force
In the early 20th century, most women in the United States did not work outside the home, and those who did were primarily young and unmarried. In that era, just 20 percent of all women were “gainful workers,” as the Census Bureau then categorized labor force participation outside the home, and only 5 percent of those married were categorized as such. Of course, these statistics somewhat understate the contributions of married women to the economy beyond housekeeping and childrearing, since women’s work in the home often included work in family businesses and the home production of goods, such as agricultural products, for sale. Also, the aggregate statistics obscure the differential experience of women by race. African American women were about twice as likely to participate in the labor force as were white women at the time, largely because they were more likely to remain in the labor force after marriage."

You must consider a number of factors before deciding on your career. Each factor plays a significant role in your choice. Firstly, always assess yourself thoroughly. You must understand your area of interest to choose a career. For instance, someone who dances well can surely become a doctor, but his interest will always be in dance. Thus, ensure that you have the caliber to perform well in the field you choose. This will come from your area of interest itself.

After that, you look for the opportunities available as per your area of interest. Now that you are aware of what you like and dislike, you can easily look for occupations matching your passion. Make a list of the occupations you can get into following your interests. Furthermore, shorten the list you have prepared. You must do so as per what suits you best. Consult with your seniors and parents to make informed decisions.

Most importantly, acquire the skills for the career option you are interested in. Ensure you earn the qualifications and degrees for it. Try taking training programs to enhance your skills. This will give you an upper hand in knowing whether you are correct in choosing the specific career plan. Furthermore, create an impressive resume which can help you get the right opportunities."

When you maintain your profile well, you will be able to get good career opportunities.

Moreover, always maintain your network. Build a solid network and create sources in the field. This way you can update yourself with the latest happenings in the industry. In addition, try to attend the related seminars and workshops that happen related to your career choice. You will meet influential people of the same field who can broaden your thinking.

Moreover, they guide students how to think about information and how to deal with questions. For example, teacher can teach us a lot of knowledge in our compulsory education. The second type is creative jobs. The creators’ purpose is that they want to bring something new to the world such as industrial designer and movie producers. They create the real things from virtual ideas. They can explain and express ideas from peoples. Also, They can even create the beautiful scene. Moreover, their works can touch people’s heart; for instance, iPhone is made from industrial designer and it is the first smart phone with touch function and Internet. When it appears on the market, it makes people crazy. The third type is laborers. The laborers’ purpose is that they maintain the functions of societies. They are like screws, which mean that they are small, but they play important roles. They are the largest group of human societies. For example, creators invent a great idea, such as iPhone, but it still needs laborers to implement it. Otherwise, just few people can enjoy the iPhone. Although their work looks simple, it is necessary in the society. In conclusion, each job has its unique place. The educator guides people. The creator achieves people’s dreams. The laborers keep the social operation going. All of them are important in our society. In my opinion, I like to be a creative because it is a challenge work."

This can be both a professional crossroads or personal crossroads. But in this essay on career, I would like to talk about the cross-road that we see in our professional career. It’s not just the students who would have faced a dilemma in deciding a career, even employees past 30 years of age face this crisis.

When a student’s face its called a beginner’s crisis, but when an employee 6 years down the lane faces dilemmas in his or her career choices, then its usually called a mid-life crisis or mid-career crisis. Midlife crisis is a term that refers to people who are having second thoughts about their career a few years down after working in the same. There might be plenty of reasons for these some of which may be an everyday monologue, fatigue, salary issues, professional growth issues, internal office dilemmas, etc. In this essay on career, I am going to talk about both the type of career choices."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"A student’s life is the first crossroad that we face in our lives. By keeping certain factors in mind, there is plenty of career choice a student can choose from. Some of the popular career choices are engineering, medicine, arts, and commerce. Which career to choose and on what terms is something that every student will have to worry about. There are certain criteria to choose a career, which are:

Criteria to Choose a Career

Passion: The word passion sounds cliche, but it is an important criterion to consider before choosing a career path. If everyone follows their passion and chose a career accordingly, then the concept of a mid-career crisis wouldn’t have occurred in the first place. Every one of us would have dreamt of something during our childhood. We all wanted to become a police, a cricketer, an actor, a doctor or an engineer. But not everyone follows and listens to the child in them. We ultimately give up on our passions and choose a safe career which will give us a good salary. Risk-taking is a part and parcel of life and no one should regret not doing something 80 years down the lane when they are on their death bed.
Stability: Financial stability, as well as job stability, is something that should be considered as an important criterion. Because the world is increasingly changing and many industries are being taken out by emerging technologies. So before choosing a particular career path, the stability as the well the salary factors should be taken into account
Future prospects: Future prospects, both in terms of your interest in the field as well the survival of the field itself, in the next 20 years should be taken into consideration. A Mid-career crisis can be avoided if future prospects are evaluated properly. Certain industries might fall and certain might become the next biggest phenomenon. People who are serious about their careers choose a path which has a long-lasting prospect
Satisfaction: This is another important factor while choosing a career path. A good salary, a nice work environment and a good location might give some people the job satisfaction they need, but there are some people who are not affected by any of that. The only thing that matters to them is the job itself. Usually, a job that is socially helpful is the ones that provide true satisfaction.
This essay on career is written from a student’s point of view. But an essay on career from an employee’s point of view will be totally different. The factors mentioned above might not even be relevant to them anymore. But this essay on career in mainly confined to the beginner’s journey."

This represents a substantial and coherent body of work in an important sub-discipline of sociology. This volume assembles the best of these writings in one single accessible place. The ten essays are republished in their original form, each bearing the traces of the time and place it was written. In sum, they provide a fascinating account of an academic journey. They are introduced with a foreword from the author, who places the work in context and offers some thoughts about how the work might be used by scholars in developing the field, to evaluate, for example, the effects of the New Labour period on professional autonomy. The essays will be indispensable to sociologists with a general interest in the professions and to scholars of law, medicine and business."

,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"I do not believe the Army can currently be viewed as a profession, or an organization of professionals, because of several glaring reasons. The reasons for my opinion are lack of continued education, lack of desire to make a long-term career, bureaucratic policies hindering motivation, and lack of pride or discipline. Jobs that are generally viewed as professions by the public are those of doctors or lawyers. These are jobs that require a dedication to that career field as well as years of study to become proficient. Right now, the Army does not have the key elements that make it a profession.

The first reason for not considering the Army as a profession is lack of continued education. Although the Army has schools in place, as well as self-development tools, it lacks the time to develop professionals. According to the Army White Paper “The Profession of Arms,” it states professionals take years to develop  . While the Soldier’s Creed states every Soldier is a professional. If this is the case, why are Soldiers expected to be professionals after just weeks of training? Not only do Soldiers not have the years of education coming in to the Army, but also all Soldiers come from different backgrounds making it nearly impossible to turn each one into a professional after only weeks. It is true the Army is entrusted to provide security to the American people, and professionals are entrusted citizens in society, but all Soldiers are not professionals . Senior level officers and NCOs have years of experience to build on, and yet many are still not professionals. Actions of a few Soldiers at all levels do not equate to a professional standard and factors are present which prevent the Army from being viewed as a profession. Some factors are education gaps, no desire to make the Army a career, the bureaucracy of the Army, and Soldiers not having a pride or discipline in what they do. It is my opinion without a change to these factors, the Army cannot be viewed as a professional organization. The lack of education and presence of bureaucracy go against the fostering of a profession."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"There are many reasons why the Army should be considered a profession.  The Army trains and certifies its members, has continuing development of its personnel, and contains many professions within it.  Much like doctors and lawyers, the Army requires each member to complete training and certification.  The Army focuses on development of its personnel to maintain skills important to the profession.   Aside from the profession itself, the Army contains many other professions.  The U.S. Army has and will continue to maintain and advance the profession through study and intellectual development.
The Army takes great strides to ensure it members are fully qualified professionals.  All professions, such as accounting and psychology, are certified and monitored by a governing body familiar to that field, such as a state bar or the state psychological association.  The same is true within the Army, as members must complete requirements set by their respective branch.  Similar to nursing, each rank requires a certain level of specialized education and certification.   Officers and enlisted personnel will spend years in their fields completing various levels of education in order to become experts.
The Army places an immense importance on developing leaders to maintain the profession.
As General Dempsey states in his White Paper, “Leader development is an investment required to maintain the Army as a profession and is a key source of combat power.  Leadership entails the repetitive exercise of discretionary judgments, all highly moral in nature, and represents the core function of the Army professional’s military art, whether leading a patrol in combat or making a major policy or budget decision in the Pentagon.”
The Army  Other professions within the Army will grow as needs change but they will all still be an important piece.  For the Army to succeed the future, it must require study and intellectual development therefore maintaining it as a profession."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"Individuals who enter the field of education reply to the question why teach with various answers. There is beauty, joy, and fulfillment in this profession, and these spirit-lifting emotions are the result of watching annually as a new group of children enter to learn and leave with the knowledge to achieve. Richard Dufour (2000), author of Why Teach expressed his views on the profession first by stating that teaching is not the career for everyone.  He goes on to say, that the education profession has the ability to present the “unique opportunity” for individuals to cast a positive influence upon others (Why Teach, 2000, p.1). The smiles received from a room full of students when as a whole their individual needs, both educational and personal have been catered to, prompts a burst of passion in every teacher.
Those who look to the profession as a career would need to nourish these perceptions in order to prevail over the negative aspects that surround the profession.  The process of teaching goes far beyond the presentation of facts, it includes the dedication of both heart and time.  While compensation and working conditions are the main downfalls in teaching, there are many other situations that cause individuals to turn away from the profession.  Teaching is obviously a hard complex job and the individuals who answer the call, encounter many frustrations.  They are required to first develop goals for classroom instruction and with these goals develop lesson plans, while implementing effective classroom management (appropriate discipline).  They must also monitor and nourish the special needs of every child, and stay current on educational advancements and topic knowledge.  Imagine trying in the future knowledge and the chance for a humane society.
President George Bush’s “No Child Left Behind Act” fails to focus on the recruitment and diversity within the profession.  He sets a goal for the year 2005 for every classroom to have a quality teacher but no goal for retaining these teachers.   The improvement of the profession requires a national step-by-step effort.   The purpose of this paper was to gather and explore information on the teaching profession and with it explore the shortage within in order to educate and strike up reform.  It is clear, that reform will require a lot of time and money. The end product however, will show success within the profession thereby equaling success in the classroom.  Success comes when present in the classrooms are caring and committed teachers, all with the goal of education and diversity is among them. .

It was not long before I realized that I was, in many ways, different from all the other kids in school. Gradually, I became less confident and more isolated. One day in the schoolyard, while I was playing hopscotch alone, a girl named Becca walked up to me and asked if she could join in. Although we had difficulty understanding one another's speech, we had no problem communicating through gestures and expressions. We soon realized that we had different ways of playing hopscotch. I watched her way and she watched mine; presently we came up with a brand new version of the game. Others soon joined us, and I found myself playing and laughing with kids whom I had thought I had nothing in common with. I have learned so much from Becca, but most of all I learned to not be afraid to build relationships with people who differ from me. Over the years, I have tried to live by this rule, and, as a result, have enjoyed many memorable and enriching relationships which have contributed to my desire to work with others in the practice of medicine.
One such relationship is with a woman named Jeanette. Our relationship began when I became Jeanette's reader through the Pittsburgh Vision Center, where I work as a volunteer. Before meeting Jeanette, I had never interacted with a blind person. At our first meeting, she was excited to tell me about the new computer she had just purchased and a movie that she had recently seen, making no reference to her blindness. I soon forgot that she was blind myself. ""Did you see that blue jay that just landed on the tree outside?"" I blurted. There was a moment of awkwardness, as I tried desperately to come up with a way to explain my thoughtlessness. Jeanette saved me by requesting that I describe the scene to her. As I did so, a smile appeared on her face, and she responded, ""I see it now."" Later, it occurred to me that just as Jeanette had benefited from my way of perceiving the world, I could benefit form her way of ""seeing"" as well.

Although most people underestimate the profound role that educators play in today’s society, teachers have a tremendous responsibility. They have the opportunity to not only challenge their students intellectually, but they can teach them how to gear what they have learned toward positive goals and how to use their knowledge for good.



As a potential educator, it is my hope I can provide a stronger educational background for my students, but more importantly, they will leave my classroom with a strong sense of who they are. I hope to teach them to have compassion and a regard for others. My goal is to help students understand that it does not matter what occupation they end up pursuing. All that matters is that they do their job to the best of their ability. Although a certain career may not pay as much as another, in many other ways, it can be just as rewarding.



I want my students to understand that even though they may be labeled as unimportant by other people, they can still accomplish great things. I have found these principles to be very true after watching the life of my grandfather. He was not a doctor or a great business man, instead, he was a coal miner. In all of the movies, West Virginia’s coal miners are portrayed as leading uneducated and unhappy lifestyles. My grandpa proved that this certainly was not the case. He was one of the smartest men I have ever known and although his job may not have appeared to be of any great importance, he proved that he could from experience and the teacher is only a guide or a supervisor of their learning. I prefer progressivism over any other philosophy because education should be geared more towards the needs and interests of the students.



My overall teaching philosophy is to be a good role model for the students, to teach them that everybody is unique, and that they are all of equal importance. Teaching may not be the best paying profession, but I feel that if do my best, I can achieve great things. It does not matter how much the salary will be. What matters the most is that teaching can be an everyday adventure and it is extremely rewarding to know that you have made such an impact on someone else. As an educator, I hope to not only prepare students to move on to the next level, but to teach them values and principles that they will carry with them for the rest of their lives."

Like culture in any other group of people, Army culture is shared amongst soldiers. Soldiers generally share the same values, attitudes, practices, and goals. This culture characterizes the Army as whole. Army beliefs and values are put in place by the regulations and policies put in place to keep soldiers conscious of their behavior and ethics. The Army Ethics are defined by the seven Army Values; loyalty, duty, respect, service, honor, integrity, and courage. The Army Values are the root of Army culture and ethics. Army culture can be a complex ideal to understand, however, it is all boiled down to acting and carrying oneself so as to not bring discredit to the Army or the United States.

HR professionals in the Army have the role in supporting the army culture and ensuring the balance of leadership roles. A HR Sergeant’s role is also to uphold, promote, and protect the professions values and ethics. All for the purpose of achieving the main goal of the profession of arms.

Sociology of the Professions
... A profession maintains social recognition through governmental and public support for the profession's systems (Dingwall, 2008). Because professions share features with other occupations, and many occupations include specialisations and requirements for training and development (Evetts, 2014), the concept of profession as distinct from other occupations is contested (Evetts, 2013;Sciulli, 2010). ...
... Government and public support for a profession's systems enables social recognition (Dingwall, 2008) and a professional identity for the field to develop. Professions such as psychology and teaching are governmentally regulated with professional standards and clearly defined entry pathways that include relevant qualifications and training. ...
Career development: Profession or not?
... For example, the knowledgebase of a profession is often contested territory, and is controlled by various disciplinary practices (Foucault 1979). A profession's accepted knowledge-base is under threat from within, as well as from contiguous professions on the outside (Dingwall 2008). A profession struggles for legitimacy especially when its knowledge-base is unstable and the application of this knowledgebase to practical problems is therefore uncertain (Wilson 1993). ...
... The commoditising of the professions such as occupational therapy runs in parallel with an EBP movement and the disempowerment of health professionals (Speed and Gabe 2013;Sullivan 2000) derived out of the relationship between neoliberalism and externally derived competencies and regulation. Although it has been argued that some professional groups have held too much power and are not always representative of the populations they serve (Dingwall 2008), it has also been argued that the loss of professional agency will lead to a decrease in the ability of professions, such as occupational therapy, to challenge policy that runs contrary to the profession's values whilst simultaneously decentring professional agency, knowledge and skills required for a cohesive professional identity (Clouston and Whitcombe 2008;Copnell 2010). This can result in a tension between more nuanced areas of professional practice that revolve around 'patient-centeredness' and 'outcomes based practice' and drive for 'efficiencies' (Bell et al 2015:3). ...

... Status is central both to social structure and social interaction, though it is far from being an unambiguous concept. Like role, it is a fluctuating notion, which can either be framed in Durkheim's functionalist theories of socio-economic stratification (Dingwall, 2012) or in theories focusing on moral values, which are detached from economic power (Lane, 2000). Although the notions of status and prestige are often used interchangeably, in Sociology they are studied separately, as they fall into two completely different categories: status is determined by institutional and economic parameters, whereas prestige is influenced by social and symbolically functional codes. ...
... A central concept in the sociology of the professions is professional autonomy and the degree to which professionals are free to determine the training, content and rewards for their work (Dingwall 2008, Freidson 1985. Key characteristics of professional autonomy include expert knowledge and practice (Harrison and Dowswell 2002); self-evaluation of performance and care ; control over the nature and volume of medical tasks (Harrison and Ahmad 2000); and an etiquette of equality of competence across the profession. ...

On the other hand, the occupations as well as some lesser professions tend to have a ""low ceiling"" for deviations meaning they are expected to obey more than to be authoritative. ...

... In the self-regulatory model, the government's power to regulate in the public interest is devolved, at least in part, to the profession and backed by the coercive power of the state. Professional self-regulation entails an implicit contract between the government and the professions: the government grants the power to regulate, which lends legitimacy, autonomy, and socioeconomic benefits to the profession, in consideration for the profession's commitment to regulate itself in the public interest and bear the costs of implementing the legislative will of the government (Dingwall, 2008;Flood, 2011). ...

Nursing as a Profession: Old Tensions, New Insights"
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"This collection of essays is a reprint of a series of Robert Dingwall's articles on professions published between 1976 and 2006. They provide an interesting insight into the development of British medical sociology over the last thirty years, in terms of their theoretical inspirations, methodological approaches and empirical concerns.

In theoretical terms these essays draw on some obvious classic sources such as Max Weber and Emile Durkheim though Karl Marx is conspicious by his absence, as well as some less obvious sources, including John Milton, Adam Smith and Herbert Spencer. Dingwall (pp. 111–126) invokes John Milton in an analysis of the foundation myths of professions, especially the lost golden era of gung-ho innovation which in most myths have been replaced by routininisation, surveillance and bureaucratic control (pp. 61–2), and draws attention to Adam Smith's justification for treating professions differently to guilds and ensuring that professionals are properly rewarded so that the professions are able to attract trustworthy practitioners. Dingwall (pp. 85–98) is concerned to rehabilitate Herbert Spencer's work whose influence on sociology was limited by his lack of Political Correctness and his stand against social intervention and meliorism. He makes a convincing case for Spencer's contribution to the study of professions, especially through Spencer's insight that in various ways modern professions have taken on the creative and moral functions exercised by religion in premodern society.

The essays are selective in the use of more recent sources. There is a strong emphasis on American sociology – especially Talcott Parsons, Elliot Freidson and Everett Hughes – with some referencing of British sociology, especially Phil Strong and Terry Johnson. There is very little reference however to European sociology, some use of Alfred Schütz and a passing reference to Michel Foucault but no use of to Jürgen Habermas or Ulrich Beck, nor to contemporary anglophone sociolgists such as Anthony Giddens or Bryan Turner.

Some of the essays in the collection are theoretical discussions of the origins, development and contemporary role of professions whereas other apply theory to specific empirical case studies. The essays provide important insight into the development of professions as institutions and their changing relationship to the state. In the early essays the emphasis is on the ways in which professions lay claim to expertise and manipulate the divison of occupations to establish an exclusive licence to practice, one that gives them a dominant postion within a sphere of activity. In the later essays, following the economic and political crises of the1970s and the political responses of the 1980s such as New Public Management and the Audit State, the emphasis shifts from the demand for and capturing of professional privileges to the state's role in suppling and withdrawing such privileges. For example, in the UK in the late 1990s the New Labour government substantially restricted medical self-regulation with increased external surveillance and control through clinical governance.

However, given the theoretical inspiration of the essays there are some important aspects of professions of the broader role of professions within society which are relatively underdeveloped. Giddens's important insight that in late modernity individuals take increased responsibility for their own lifecourse, and in doing so they rely increasingly on abstract systems and mediated representations, focuses attention on the way in which professionals represent and provide one point of access to such abstract systems. The role of professionals is particuarly important when individuals have to take ‘fateful’ decisions which will irreversibly change their lifecourse. In this context professionals provide the human face of an abstract body of knowledge and there is a range of important issues this raises, including: the role of professions in constructing and managing individual and collective uncertainty and risks, the ways in which users judge or trust professionals as access points, the facework which professionals engage in, the impact of government policy on users confidence in the system and trust in access points, the role of alternative access points, and the impact of current government policies such as evidence-based practice on the nature of and access to abstract systems. Some of these issues are touched on in the essays but none are addressed in depth.

Branding a publication as a classic raises expectations. While there is much of interest in this collection of essays and some important insights, I am not totally convinced I would see it as the definitive statement on the nature of professions and their role in contemporary society. Articles and book chapters are by their nature limited to a single theme and issue and it is difficult to achieve the complexity and depth of analysis in a short collection of essays which such an important topic merits."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"In our time, each profession is important and necessary in its own way. There are many professions in the world. They are different, many-sided. Sometimes a person dreams of becoming an actor, a singer, an artist, but becomes a worker, teacher or journalist. But it does not mean. that he betrayed his dream. He can also be an amateur actor, and also maintain a love of singing or drawing, perfect it. But the most important thing in our time is higher education. After all, not studying at university, you can forget about a good and prestigious career.
But it happens to many that the ability to own this or that business is already in the blood, but you still need to learn. Many people believe that studying for an electrician, fitter or car mechanic is not prestigious. And how would we live without these specialists. There are many different professions in the world, it should be chosen according to the soul. You need to learn and work with pleasure. If a person is closer to creative professions, for example, such as. a teacher of music, a choreographer, an actor, a director, an artist, he will not be an economist or an accountant, and he will not work with pleasure. After graduating from school, crowds of young people begin an independent life. Everybody knows. that means to choose a profession, because sooner or later it will affect everyone.
Most choose a profession based on wages, less often from demand. and very few people choose a profession for the soul, and this is the most important thing. Of course, in life it is important to find a “one’s” profession. exactly the one that you like and your soul, so as not to suffer from unloved work. But unfortunately. often young people choose not what they want. but then. that is necessary, parents force. or go after friends, and thus kill talent. Choice of profession is a complex and responsible step in the life of every person for whom training and knowledge are needed. In this case, you can not be frivolous, because we all want. that the work pleased us, according to our interests. adequately paid.

There are no unnecessary professions in our life. At present, there are about 6,000 professions in Russia, and it is very difficult for many people to orient themselves in such a variety. Personally, I choose the profession myself, despite that. that my parents were against it at first. I’m going to be a sound engineer. I have many plans in this area. I want to work at a recording studio, but at once I can not achieve this, I need practice for several years. Practice I will be in the Samara Philharmonic. in ODL, or in the theater, but for this you must first finish the institute, so I’m going to go to study in this specialty.
But without music data in this area it is better not to pop. Fortunately, I do music and I think that it will help me. I would also like to work as a sound engineer with a well-known group or work in a club, put a good sound. But while these are just ideas, and that they are implemented, it is necessary to enter the university. I think that I have correctly determined my choice of profession and I will never regret it."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"Everyone in this world has his own likes and dislikes. So is the case with choosing one’s profession. There are host of good professions to choose from. As a child, everyone talks of becoming something which they like or which amuses them but choosing a career is a serious task. It is quite difficult to choose a profession.

The whole life of a person depends on his or her profession and so one must have an aim in life. An aimless life is like a ship without a rudder or like a letter without an address. Hence, there arises the necessity of choosing a profession.

The Choice of a Profession Essay

Although I am not old enough to choose a profession, yet I would like to set my aim in mind to derive me for it. Thus, I have dream of becoming a doctor. A doctor, a healer, a time-honoured ancient profession. I have always been interested and fascinated in the field of study of the biology or human science. The idea of being able to help ill people and relieve the physical and mental problems of the sick affects me, it is really a pious task. I have always foreseen myself doing that. I want to take up ‘medicine’ as my profession for the simple reason that I would like to ‘help’ people.

Medicine has many advantages over other professions. It is an ideal and a noble profession in the sense that a doctor remains honest and hardworking in his profession. Doctor is a saviour for thousands and God for all. Doctors are able to make a difference, a real difference between life and death."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"A doctor’s life is hard. Often, he has to visit a patient during his off hours, forgoing rest, sleep, and even food. Sometimes the doctor has to work day and night, attending to serious patients or victims of war, epidemic or major accident. Doctor always treats his patients with a smile and a cheer. He motivates and encourages sick persons. He is a source of hope and strength to his patients. Even if he is in distress his duty is first towards his patient. Doctors have to be charitable, dedicated, hardworking and friendly to their patients.

This hard life of doctor is worth living, just a gesture of thanks from patients make doctors go on to live this hard life. Doctors are like soldiers on the battle frontier where they face death every hour and give it a tough fight and come out victorious from many such combats.

A doctor is true healer and philanthropist and I looking forward to becoming the holy and honoured doctor. I know it would take a lot of hard work on my part to cherish this dream. I am ready to put in all the hard work and want to be a great doctor and serve poor and ailing people."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"Essay on Concept of Occupation – The words Work and Occupation are often used interchangeably. In fact, Occupation is essen­tially a kind of work. But the word ‘Occupation’ is used mostly to refer to the specialised and estab­lished kind of work.

It refers to some kind of work with which an individual becomes completely engaged. It denotes the habitual employment, profession, craft or trade of an individual. It takes up much of his time and attention. In modern connotations it means an instrument of livelihood. It is usually associated with one or the other kind of orgainsation; agriculture, industry, governmental organisation, etc.

People pursue one occupation or other in order to eke out their livelihood. It has become an essential feature of the modern economic life. Life without occupation or profession of any kind is simply inconceivable today. The importance of occupations is recognised by the sociolo­gist and accordingly a branch of sociology has emerged to deal with the phenomenon of occupation, the Sociology of Occupations."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"Classification of Occupations:

Peter Berger has suggested a threefold classification of occupation.

Firstly, there are those occupations which provide some kind of Self-identification and satis­faction. Ex: Professions like teaching, contracting, business, agriculture and craft or artistic occupa­tions.

Secondly, there are tasks which are almost the exact opposite. They are seen as a direct threat to person’s identity, reducing him to the status of “an appendage to a machine”. Ex: The poorly paid occupations of labourers, who work in big factories, industries, business firms, mining concerns, agricultural fields, coffee, tea, rubber and such other estates, etc., represent such occupations.

Thirdly, there are occupations regarded as neutral, that is, they are neither a direct threat to one’s personal identity nor a major source of identity. Such occupations are neither very hateful nor very pleasurable.

Ex: The occupations of bankers, life insurance employees, high level government executives, clerks, accountants, etc., which are prosaic and monotonous but fetching handsome sal­ary, represent such neutral occupations.

Berger argues that the first two types have declined in modern society. It is also because, working for large bureaucratic organisations results in a loss of personal freedom, and secondly many unpleasant and routine tasks have been eliminated in modern industry.

It is to be noted that occupations have become very much diversified and complex today. The nature and type of occupations go on changing in accordance with the change in the industrial advancement.

The modern industrial system has evolved through different stages like—(1) the fam­ily economy, (2) the guild or handicraft system, (3) domestic industry, and (4) the modern industrial or factory system (Capitalist or industrial economy). In all these stages occupations differ significantly."
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"Technology has been at the heart of human progress since times immemorial. Technology is the practical and methodical application of knowledge and use of techniques which supports/enables application of science, existing resources and human know-how in productive activities and contributes in development.

It brings change, for firms as well as for nations, it brings competitiveness and sustainability. During the last 60 years the technology has given birth to many new products and also many a products becoming redundant. Two basic questions to be raised in terms of technological developments are – (i) to what extent are existing technologies maturing? and (ii) What technological developments or trends are affecting or could affect the industry?

Communication and Information Technology have added a new dimension to technology, innovation and its diffusion. Telecommuting through use of telecommunication technology has made it possible to work from home or other off-the office areas. While internet offers many opportunities including e-commerce, m-commerce, the privacy issue is a matter of concern."
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"Another technological change is Nanotechnology. It is likely to change the way in which everything – including medicine, computers, and cars – is designed and constructed.

Space travel technology and stem cell research are the other important technologies of 21st Century.

Many of the products we use were not there 100 years back: Mobile Phones, Personal Computer, Microwave Oven, Refrigerators, Televisions, Washing Machines, Dishwashers, Frozen Foods, etc. And, many products we use are endangered to extinguish. Technological advances must be seen as ‘constructive’ or ‘creative destruction’ which often has a fatal effect on existing products.

The invention of xerography photocopying destroyed the market for carbon paper, mobile phone replaced pagers, and development of cars dented demand for public transport. Technology provides both opportunities and threats. The business of greeting cards, postal letters and fax significantly eroded when people started to send emails.

Some of the important trends illustrate the future impact of technology in our changing world: “Smart dust”, or network of cheap, low-power computerized sensors will start monitoring the food, workplaces, and the welfare of nations."
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"There will be increased convergence among core technologies, with PCs and TVs and entertainment becoming more integrated. There is already convergence of different gadgets into one. For example, a mobile phone provides the service of a phone, camera, e-mail, organiser, clock, radio, telephone directory, etc. The mobile phone’s use for camera has made Kodak bankrupt.

Open source, the free software movement that was started by Linux, will become the norm for further innovation.

Virtual auctioning and new methods of pricing will emerge on the Internet.

The proliferation of wireless broadband products and services will increase connectivity and spur globalisation."
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"Neurotechnology, defined as the application of tools, drugs, and diagnostics for influencing human nervous system, especially the brain, will have a far reaching impact on treating mental illness, such as Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia, as well as bolstering the immune system, and eventually one’s longevity.

Mesh networks, of connections between nodes that are self-healing or are enabled to hop from node to node, will accelerate broadband connectivity that will, in turn, create radically new business models and transform patterns of work and recreation. In times to come 50% of the telephones will be made through internet.

The technology has made manufacturing faster. It took just six days to build the 15-storied Ark Hotel in Changsha in China.

Technology has forced firms to go in for innovation. Innovation has become a great tool for creating differentiation. Foster and Kaplan have classified innovation into incremental (to make product more attractive but not changing it fundamentally), substantial (involve major change – in between newness and impact), and Transformational (new value proposition and a new way to manufacture, distribute, and/or market the offering).

The pace of technological change has become very fast. Now a new generation of computer is out every three months. It is why, the pace of new product launches has become faster and products are simultaneously launched across the globe. All new products replace the old products. LCD has changed DVD and DVD had changed VCR; diesel-electric locomotives replaced steam engines, transistors have replaced vacuum tubes, ball point pens have replaced fountain pens, nuclear power is overtaking fossil fuel plants, and electric razors are overtaking safety razors.

There are unlimited opportunities for innovation. The technological changes have provided many marketers opportunities, then a many are also feeling the heat of threats. Internet has posed a threat for the postal services, mobile phone posed a threat for STD booths, e-mail has outpaced fax services, and electronic watches have posed a threat to mechanical watch industry of Switzerland. Biotechnology, microelectronics, robotics, and designer goods are undertaking some of the exciting R&D.
"
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"Information and telecom technology through computers, laptops, mobile phones, internet, tablets, etc. have revolutionised the business world. Cost of logistics has come down because of technology. Everyday new products are introduced and new media are used to promote them – all because of technology. But one thing is important that advent of new technology does not mean end of the growth of existing technology.

Technology has made a great impact on customer value – first, the cost of technology is plummating, thus customer is concentrating on other features of the product; second, technology provides value through the development of new products; third, it can change existing products; and it provides internet, intranet and extranets to bring down the cost.

Some of the technological changes are delayed by regulatory framework. At the same time some of the technological changes have become debatable, like cloaning, and Genetically modified food.

Thus a marketer will have to be innovative, otherwise the survival will be endangered. From the customers’ perspective technology impacts all activities from eating to drinking to sleeping to sex to health care and work performance."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"In a society enamored with the gain and worship of money and luxury, debasement of the vocation can be the only result. Even though money is a necessity in life, occupations are a tool to express the worker as a person, as well as to express his beliefs. This requires a proper attitude and outlook on life and on one's occupation. With a preoccupation for money, careers are no longer places to enjoy their passions, and an enjoyed, proper occupation is essential in a healthy, well-rounded life. Although some believe that one's career is merely an outlet for money to support a family, having a job one feels called to and enjoys is essential, because in a career based solely on gain, the worker's mindset is wrong, and the quality of his work will be hindered.
Though money is a very important commodity in life, the true career is a means of fulfillment, not with riches, but a means of bringing satisfaction to the worker. People should not devote their lives to vocation merely for the gain of money, but more for the fulfillment of the soul. When focused solely on the gain of money, all else is ignored. The thought of what to do with the next paycheck dominates the mind. A few weeks later, the money is gone, and the mind of the worker is now focused on the next payday. Money is a temporary means of fulfillment, unlike emotional satisfaction. Using your career for something that makes you happy for a week or two instead of what gives you fulfillment every day you are working is not logical. For example, it would not be wise for someone who disliked his job to keep it just because he gained a certain amount of money from it. Sayers explains that people commonly believe, falsely, that, ""work is not the expression of man's creative energy in the service of society, but only something he does in order to obtain money and leisure"" (Creed or Chaos 52). This example points out a major problem in common thought about occupations. The worker's creative energy is lost when he approaches and uses his career in this manner. It is this energy that helps man to express his feelings, and with the loss of creative energy, work is downsized to an outlet that feeds greed and laziness. Because of the lack of fulfillment this outlet causes, not even money or leisure can keep the occupant of this career satiated."
,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"I think that starting a job is never easy. Obviously, being an employee presupposes a bulk of responsibility you have to shoulder. In its turn, responsibility entails a certain amount of skills that can guarantee good quality of your work. Looking back at my first job interview, I can’t get rid of that ‘butterflies-in-the-stomach’ feeling that I was going to fail or it would be a complete flop. Later it appeared out to be very unwise of me to question my own abilities; however, this is what hinders young people to have a go and get their foot in the door.
My first job was about teaching and I am still into it. I started it a couple of years ago and I haven’t quitted yet. I have been teaching English for about two years at the local center for foreign students. My foremost responsibility is to create a friendly learning environment for every student and facilitate the learning process in a dynamic way. It seems clear that I have to do much talking (holding center stage in class, negotiating with parents and co-workers, etc.), so improving communication skills is a top priority for me. The duties I have to accomplish, i.e. coordinating, supervising and evaluating students’ work, encouraging learning ambitions and developing critical thinking in the field of studying, require expertise of present-day methodologies as well as innovative approaches seeking to provide students with psychological comfort. I have enjoyed freedom in selecting class activities and applying relevant teaching methods in my work, though sometimes there were senior teachers assessing efficiency of interaction between my students and me. The center where I work organizes monthly workshops for young teachers, which helps them obtain a better understanding of technicalities of the teacher’s job and highlights of modern teaching strategies. A welcoming atmosphere has ensured friendly relationships with all the co-workers and prevented negative attitudes of jealousy and envy, not to mention discrimination.
In a nutshell, I was bestowed with the unique chance of unleashing my potential at the outset of my professional development and I sincerely believe this the right path to success.

,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"Often in the world there are jobs that come across as rather boring or tedious to complete day in and day out. However, it is a must to keep these jobs as they allow us to provide basic needs for ourselves in life. Some types of occupations consist of a specialised job, with this, the five core job characteristics derived from the job characteristics model also apply to these jobs. Furthermore, the five job features are known to be skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy and feedback, each having their own importance. By identifying the characteristics, three redesigning techniques can be implemented being establishing client relationships which are, combining tasks, establishing client relationships and vertically loading the job. The specialised job holds the job characteristics and can be redesigned as well to improve on some of those five task features.

Mortgage brokers are known to have very demanding jobs with having to settle deals involving different types of investment properties, providing home loan services and organise large amounts of documents. However, a mortgage broker may take upon a business intern or administrator which is a specialised job, these individuals look after their documents and organise all their client files. A specialised job can be further defined as ‘a job composed of a small part of a larger task or process’ (Williams & McWilliams 2014, p. 156).

As I have matured, I realized what career I choose is something that I love and will enjoy doing for the rest of my life which for me is to be a physical therapist. My career choice didn’t cross my mind until my senior year. Other kids would always talk about becoming a cop, a doctor, and silly things like a billionaire.

When I looked up good careers on O-Net that were associated with graduating with a psychology major, one that popped up that caught my interest the most was a clinical psychologist. For this major on top of knowing and having an understanding of psychology I also have to have a knowledge of customer and personal service, law and government, understanding the English language and I have to understand counseling. All of these are important to have because if I don’t have them, then I am not completely ready to help people the way that I should be able to. The one that I feel is most important to know is the law and government understanding. If I do not know all the wrongs and rights then I can really mess up and potentially get in trouble. The skills that I will have to have will be active listening, social perceptiveness, I have to be able to have complex solving skills and be able to critically think. I think that I already am an active listener so that one fits really well with me.

Pharmacy, NOC number 3131, was the first career I chose since I like science and wanted to go into that field ().  Researching this career, many aspects of this job had similar values which persuade me in to pursing this career.

Online learning has been an advantage to reaching the goals needed for this field, and the ability to take many of the classes required from the environment of the military workplace, full of time changes and new mission requirements. Having access to online labs, at home anatomy studies, and professors able to help you from the other side of the nation have all had a unique place to the up-and-coming medical professionals. Without these technological resources, we would be unable to take the base coursework needed to complete our general studies, nor would we be able to continue our long-term coursework to complete our four-year degree requirements to continue forward to the PA Master’s degree program. Though the path to any degree may seem shaky and uncertain for some, especially in times of hardship, confidence can be had in this field as well.

Suddenly, I amalgamated these separate characters and their separate stories with each other to a unitary story concept.

My first day teaching my grade sixes a language lesson I posed a question to the group and I received responses as you would expect.

I wanted the students to have to do some thinking so the next answer I received that was not quality I responded with “do you think that sounds like a grade six answer? In grade six we need to think deeper and try to use more effective language in our writing.” The class then got very quiet and my AT seemed impressed. Immediately after the responses I was getting about the writing we were analyzing blew me away.

I spend a portion of my day in the kindergarten class and I have learned many things about how kinders function as a result. The most important being that kinders need to understand what you expect of them so that they behave accordingly. They are not too young to understand what being quiet means or what it means to sit still for a few minutes. They simply need to be expected to do so. The first time I was with the kindergarten class we had to walk to the library and they did not walk quietly or even walk at all. Their teacher then decided to repeat our walk to the library until the students learn that there is a specific way in which we walk around the school. They had to do the walk three times, but by the end of the exercise all students followed the rules. Excusing them because of their age will not help them develop life skills; it will simply set them back for their future. Another example of how raising expectations will help students achieve happened with my grade four/five class. We had them do some writing about their science experiment and some submitted work written in pen, marker, or crayon. Some did not feel that they should follow the lines, and some felt no need to write anything worth reading.

I have known for long time that leaving school is the beginning of my independent life, the beginning of a far more serious examination of my abilities and character.

What do I want to be when I leave school? It's very important question for me. A few years ago it was difficult for me to give a definite answer. As the years passed I changed my mind a lot of times about what science or field of industry to specialize in. It's difficult to make up my mind and choose one of the hundreds jobs to which I might be better suited. A coupe of years ago I wanted to become a doctor, you know I wanted to help people who had problems with health. Then I wanted to become a policeman, then a spaceman, I even wanted to become a professional football player. But all of them now are in the past; they were like children's dreams and nothing more. Now I have already decided what to do. I'd like to be an aviator. I know that it's very difficult. I should know perfectly everything about the planes, airports, weather and other things. You know that the weather is very important thing for the flights too. I must be well educated and well informed.

You know may be something will be not OK, because I don't know what will happen tomorrow, but I know that I'll do everything to realize my plane and my dreams.

I also want to say that the profession should be chosen according to the character and hobbies of the person. That's why parents mustn't make their children choose the thing they like (parents like). Children must do it themselves. Because they must love the thing they do, believe that people need them and their job will bring them more pleasure."

,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"Economic Exchange of a student from 8/6-8/2013 My three-day economic exchange journal has invoked self-reflection as to what I define as my personal economic activity and how I go about classifying specific expenses. Aside from the typical cash/credit exchanges, a major nonmonetary payment for me involves the investment of time. Though free-time is considered by Marshall Sahlins (The Original Affluent Society) to be a form of wealth, the reality for most Americans (myself included) is that ""time is money"". The more time I allot towards non-income producing activities, the less potential I have to earn money. However, I do see a potential for ""return"" on certain time ""investments"" which I have also taken into account. Two examples of this would be towards my health and education. I categorize working-out as a short-term loss of time spent earning income and the price of a gym membership, yet a long-term yield in maintaining physical and mental health. The cost of healthcare and insurance is expensive and by maintaining my fitness, I am hoping to avoid obesity related healthcare costs in my future. This preventative effort includes (but is not limited to) diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hormonal imbalances, cognitive decline, and cancers. Additionally, having a healthy physical profile helps to keep my cost of insurance premiums at the low end of the spectrum. I also consider education to be a short-term expense of both time and money, but again an investment towards future yield in the career-path I am pursuing which is medicine. I consider extra study time also an investment towards gaining the grades and knowledge needed towards my future career. Essentially I am internally redistributing my time to provide across different types of wealth: monetary, intellectual, and health. Aside from my ""investments"" I do need to supplement my day-to-day expenses of wants and needs with my job in a research lab. Because my research is related to my career goals, I also consider it an investment towards experience within the medical field. Typically I fulfill my wants and needs through market exchange. Satisfying my wants and needs seem to be interrelated, my wants can develop from needs and vice versa. I have a health need in correcting my eyesight but also a want for an extra set of eyeglasses. My want for a pet produced needs for my pet, which is why I bought my dog the heartworm medication. I'm not sure whether to classify my mouse-trap purchase as a need or a want. I'm leaning towards considering it a need though because even though I may want to get rid of the pests, they are a disease carrying health-risk to my living conditions. Unfortunately a major need, subsistence was not well represented in my three-day journal besides my Qdoba lunch because I had already shopped for and prepared my meals earlier. Of the three forms of exchange discussed in class, I feel that I am participating in reciprocity the least. The only time I participated in that was when I helped a friend who locked his keys in his car. I picked him up, drove him to his apartment to get a spare and drove him back to his car. Perhaps one day I can depend on him to return the favor if I am ever in a ""jam."" This makes me realize that friendship is a major source of reciprocity exchange. Therefore having friends does provide a form of social wealth that can be measured through reciprocity ranging from favors to emotional support. If I could improve on my distribution of economic exchange, I'd like to include more time for leisure (because I do agree with Sahlins' argument of affluence) and also social wealth in the form of friendship or kinship."

All through the day, he works with his students. He had to attend many periods. He works till evening. He returns home very tired.

He takes a little rest and starts work again. He has to evaluate the answer sheets of the students. Sometimes he brings the note-books of the students to his home. He evaluates the answers of the note-books. At night, the teacher reads his books and prepares new lessons. He sleeps for a few hours.

,,,,,work and jobs,,,,,,,,,"I decided to write this essay because I needed something to help process everything that I am seeing and doing as a resident physician working in critical care at a large hospital in Manhattan. I feel that many people don’t have a good sense of what is actually happening in intensive care units with desperately ill COVID patients.
In some ways, I’m lucky. I work at an institution with massive resources. Even so, we are challenged in a way that I could never have predicted or imagined. In a matter of days beginning in late March, we created over double the number of ICU beds we previously had. Through a massive logistical effort, we converted operating rooms into ICUs by turning spaces that normally would be used for elective surgeries into negative-pressure units, where air is always flowing in rather than out, adding ventilators, monitors and beds.
A typical day begins at 6 A.M.  As the alarm wakes me, I feel a deep ache in my body. It feels as if I had hiked up a mountain with a giant backpack the previous day. To say my sleep is restless and difficult is an understatement. My dreams—and nightmares—are populated with patients’ faces, and I can hear the constant beeps and alarms of the pumps, vital sign monitors and ventilators even as I’m falling asleep. After checking my messages (assignments constantly shift during the pandemic), I look in the mirror.
My face is still red from the N95 mask I wore the day before. My nose is scraped and red, as if sunburned. My ears have small cuts from the plastic ties of the mask digging into them. I have worn a beard for the last five years, but because N95 masks don’t properly seal with facial hair, I shaved it off. The mirror shows a face that looks odd, like a rapidly aging and graying teenager, with blemishes on my neck from the razor and the mask.
My wife and son are still asleep. My wife is also a physician, and one of the most challenging and stressful aspects of this has been the scramble to find ad hoc childcare for our son. We have had mixed success with this. We can’t have either of our parents take care of our son; it’s too much of a risk for them because of their age and because of our constant exposure to sick patients. 
My wife and I have designated two paper bags to hold all of the clothes we wear to the hospital. I put on my “society” mask—the cloth mask homemade by my brother-in-law that I’ve designated as the one to wear when I’m not at the hospital. I have borrowed my sister’s car to drive to the hospital because the subways have become both unreliable and shockingly crowded at this time of day. I worry that I might be an asymptomatic carrier, or that I will be sausaged in next to someone who is sick.
I rush into the hospital a few minutes before seven, which is sign-out time for the night team. I change into hospital scrubs and shoes that I keep at the hospital and plan on throwing out at the end of this nightmare. I place a bandage over the bridge of my nose, to help pad my ever-increasing pressure burn, and place an N95 over my face. I hyperventilate to see if the seal is good.
Then I enter the ICU. I find it hard to find words to describe what this unit is like. The first sensory experience is the immense whir of the HEPA filters that whisk away over 99 percent of airborne virus-containing droplets to protect those who work in these units. It’s akin to standing next to a large industrial fan, forcing you to raise your voice to be heard—although your speech sounds garbled anyway when you’re talking through one or often two masks. There is an antechamber we’ve fashioned into a workroom with computers and monitors where we can write notes or check lab reports with a physical barrier between us and the patients. This is for our protection so that we aren’t being constantly exposed to virus.
The makeshift ICU I’m tending is full. After taking some time to review overnight data including urine output; vital signs; laboratory results; imaging such as chest x-rays; and changes to ventilator settings, it’s time to don even more protective personal protective equipment—a gown, a protective face shield and gloves—and enter the room where our patients are.
The whoosh from the negative-pressure fans is striking as we enter the ICU, joined by the symphony of beeping from monitors and pumps. Normally, an ICU has a private room for each patient, but nothing now is normal. Each patient presents unique challenges, though they all share a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.
The process of documenting patient information while we are in the room isn’t easy. The computers where we document our findings and enter orders for medications are in the antechamber, so we bring pieces of paper to write down data from the machines. Ensuring that intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, the severest form of COVID pneumonia, have their ventilator settings optimized is extraordinarily difficult. Their lungs are unbelievably fragile, and we have to take great care to keep the ventilator from causing any further injury.

To understand COVID-19 patients and their individual care needs, you have to understand what happens when we breathe. With every breath we take in, oxygen diffuses from the alveoli (the millions of air sacs in the lungs) to capillaries in the bloodstream. When we breathe out, the lungs expel carbon dioxide, transferred from the bloodstream back into the lungs; the technical term for this is ""ventilation."" (In pulmonary physiology, we distinguish between oxygen exchange and carbon dioxide exchange, though they are happening simultaneously.) COVID pneumonia patients have difficulty with both the uptake of oxygen and the removal of CO2.

In the weeks during which I have taken care of these patients, we’ve had success delivering oxygen to them on the ventilator, but their CO2 exchange is highly impaired—a common problem. They become hypercarbic, with excess carbon dioxide remaining in the blood. The reason could be because the lungs are highly inflamed with fluid and mucus.
During the pandemic, time both compresses and elongates. The day passes by in a frenetic whirlwind, and the toll on the body is harsh, yet a 12-hour shift can feel like a 24. In a normal ICU, most patients are very sick, but rarely is every single patient continually unstable. So both my brain and hands are constantly focused every second on stabilizing and optimizing each patient. Every hour, or sometimes more frequently, the team in the ICU goes over a list of each patient's active treatment issues: Are the kidneys failing? Are there thromboses? Do we need to add antibiotics for treatment of a bacterial pneumonia on top of the viral COVID pneumonia?
The mindset I bring to the job has had to change significantly over the past few weeks. Much of what I learned in medical school and as a resident has helped me assume my role in the intensive care unit, but this virus has also deeply humbled all of us. At times, I feel as though we need to change our perspective and acknowledge that much of what we have learned in the past about acute lung injury from viral pneumonia may not apply to this novel virus.
Normally, I work in ICUs with postsurgical patients whose disease process is often self-limited; patients quickly get better or worse. COVID-19 patients are different. The virus seems to take weeks, not days, to truly reveal how it will affect a given patient. I have had to suppress my desire to constantly tweak and change ventilator settings—normal behavior in an operating room where I spent most of my workdays prior to the pandemic. With COVID-19 patients, the changes that I want to make to the ventilator, in the hope that one day we can remove their breathing tube, have to be slow and incremental. It seems that a patient will take a step forward towards removal of the breathing tube one day, then the next day move two steps back.
I will admit, there are times that I feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of this task. But there is one story of recovery that has inspired me to keep going. Several weeks ago (it feels like a lifetime), we were paged to the ER for a patient in respiratory distress. I was astonished to find a person in their early 30s, with no known past medical history, laboring to breathe. This patient was a year younger than I am. We had to place a breathing tube and the patient remained in the ICU for two weeks, often gravely ill. One day in mid-April, I was overjoyed to find that the patient had been removed from the ventilator and had left the ICU. This young person has a chance at a normal life (although they may require a very long recovery still). I often remind myself about this patient after a particularly difficult or stressful shift.
At the end of the day, the night team arrives, and we brief them on patient status and treatment plans. Typically, nights are controlled and quiet in an ICU, with some exceptions, but not in these units. Weekends, weekdays, nights and days are completely irrelevant; it’s as if time has stopped since the virus arrived.
After sign-out, I drive home in a daze, still distracted by the day’s events. I have to consciously remember that I am driving on the West Side Highway and refocus my attention to the task at hand. Sometimes I’ll listen to music on the way home. The pandemic has sadly helped me discover how amazing a musician the late John Prine was—another victim of COVID-19.
People often talk about health care workers as soldiers or troops ""on the front lines."" I think this is an imperfect analogy. While there is no doubt that we are putting our lives on the line every day, our intention is not to make war on this virus, but to heal people. Still, I do have one thing in common with many men in uniform: my wife shaved my head into a buzzcut because my barber has been closed for the last month.

,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"My favourite book is ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway. This story is one of the well-known works of the writer. The author depicts the characters of the old man and the boy and their relations very vividly and skillfully. Santiago, the old man, was one of the writer's beloved characters. The old man was a born fisherman, but he was not a butcher and fished only for a living. He was very lonely. He had a devoted friend - the boy, Manolin. The boy loved the old man for his kind heart, his devotion to the sea. Manolin was like a son to Santiago. He took care of the old man's food and his belongings. The old man was glad to pass his experience to the boy. He looked forward to going to the sea together with the boy. All Santiago's life had been in preparation for the battle with big fish. He knew that he had been born for this and it was time to prove it. A strong man at last had met a strong fish. The battle was a difficult one and full of danger. Though the sharks had eaten the fish and nothing had left but the backbone, the old man had morally won the battle. Santiago's words ""man can be destroyed but not defeated"" are the main idea of this story. ""The Old Man and the Sea"" is a masterpiece for its imaginative language and the description of nature."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"""Library is a temple of books"", -- somebody said. And I fully agree with these wise words. Every person in our country more than 14 years old, I'm sure, at least once visited a library. The majority of young people has subscriptions to the libraries they like. The libraries not only give us a vast choice of books, but also offer excellent opportunities of having rest.

As you know, I study at the Far-Eastern State University, and I'm very proud that its library is thought to be the one of the largest in Primorye and even the whole Far-East.

Soon after our studies began, we had a course of lectures about the university library. We were told about the rules of using books we take from the library and about its catalogues. Having listened to this course, we passed an examination that showed everything we had learnt.

Soon I had to visit our library the first time as I needed a text book on economics. I went downstairs (as library is situated in the ground floor) and found a room I was searching for. But I didn't get the books immediately as there were many students in the room. So I waited for my turn. I asked the librarian if I could get the book on economical theory. She brought me a book which name was ""Modern economics"". Than the librarian asked me if I used the library's services for the first time. I answered that it was true, and she suggested me to get a reader's ticket. I was interested to know what documents I had to provide for this. She told that she needed only my photo and some money. Fortunately, I had picture with myself and two minutes later I was an owner of the reader's ticket, which proves that I am a real member of the university library.

So, that is my story about our library. By the way, I want to say you that I was greatly surprised the level of service in it. It was very pleasant to meet kind librarian that was eager to help in everything you ask."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"We can't imagine our life without books. They play a very important part in our life.

Books are our friends. We meet them when we are very small and can't read, but we remember our mother read them for us. We learn very much from books.

Books educate people in different spheres of life. They develop our imagination, make us think and analyse. They help to form our character and the world outlook. Books help us in self education and in deciding problems of life. They make our life more interesting.

People read both for knowledge and for pleasure. Different people read different books. They help us with our lessons and work. We read serious books which help us understand the life, give us answers to questions which worry us, they make us think.

Many people enjoy so-called ""easy reading""- detectives, amusing, humorous stories, fantastic. But so many people, so many tastes.

As for me, I prefer to read adventure stories, full of interesting real fact and pictures, and detectives. My favourite author is Arthur Conan Doyle with his Holmes' adventures."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Libraries play an important role in the cultural development of a country. People have a desire to learn, they seek knowledge. Books satisfy this desire.

We can find all kinds of books in libraries: novels, biographies, fiction, short stories, books on traveling, technical books, books for children, magazines and so on. In some libraries we can find books in many foreign languages.

When readers come to a library for the first time they fill in their library card and the librarian helps them to choose something to read. The readers are allowed to borrow books for a certain number of days. The catalogues help readers to find the book they need. Reading rooms are open to everybody who wishes to work there. Besides books we can get periodicals, newspaper files and magazines to read there. Readers come to reading- rooms to study and prepare material for reports or for scientific work. Sometimes libraries are called the treasure house of information because books enrich our experience with that of the other people.

I enjoy books of different genres: adventure and detective stories, science fiction and fantasies. I would like to tell you about my favorite book – Harry Potter.

It is one of the most amusing book I've read during the last few years. I am sure that everybody agrees with me that this is the most enjoyable, entertaining and fascinating book which is read with great interest by children and adults as well."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"I think this novel is very popular among children because it consists of several parts. In each part HP, the main character of the novel, becomes older and older and the young reader grows up with him while reading the book chapter by chapter. In fact HP is a boy of our age.

This is the story of ordinary children having extraordinary adventures.

The life of the author has much in common with the life of her hero – It was not always easy. J.Rowling was born on the 31 of July 1965 in a small town near Bristol, England. This is the same date of birth as HP has.

After divorce she lived on a public assistance in a tiny Edinburgh flat with her infant daughter. Then she wrote her first book named ""HP and the Philosopher's stone"" and it was HP that rescued her from poverty. The first book was a hit for both - children and adult readers.

The Scottish Art Council gave her a grant to finish the book. HP won the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and many other prizes on both sides of the Atlantic. Book rights were sold to England, France, Italy, Germany, Greece, Holland, Finland, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Russia and many other countries of Europe.

J.Rowling is the novelist whose science fiction fantasy HP series originally intended for young readers has crossed generational boundaries and has many adult fans."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Great Britain gave the world a lot of talented people. Many famous writers and poets were born and lived in Great Britain.One of the best known English playwrights was William Shakespeare. He draw ideas for his tragedies and comedies from the history of England and ancient Rome. Many experts consider Shakespeare the greatest writer and the greatest playwright in English language. William Shakespeare wrote 37 plays which may be divided into: comedies (such as ""A Midsummer Night's Dream""), tragedies (such as ""Hamlet"", ""Othello"", ""King Lear"", ""Macbeth"") and historical plays (such as ""Richard II"", ""Henry V, ""Julius Caesar"", ""Antony and Cleopatra"").

Robert Burns represents the generation of Romantic writers. In his poems he described with love and understanding' the simple life he knew. Among his well-known poems are ""Halloween"", ""The Jolly Beggars"", ""To a Mouse"".

Lord George Gordon Byron. His free-spirited life style combined with his rare poetic gift makes him one of the most famous figures of the Romantic Era. His famous works such as ""Stanzas to Augusta"", ""The Prisoner of Chillon"", ""Childe Harold's Pilgrimage"", ""Manfred"" draw readers into the passion, humors and conviction of a poet whose life and work truly embodied the Romantic spirit.

Sir Walter Scott wrote the first examples of historical novel, for instance, ""Ivanhoe"".

Lewis Carroll became famous when he published ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland""."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Nowadays it's almost impossible to imagine our life without books. I think it's one of the greatest wonders in the world. Many years ago or maybe centuries people valued books as treasure of the human knowledge and experience.

As for me I like to read books in my free time. Books help me to distract from my problems and daily routine and to get into another world. I like the various genres of books. It depends on my mood which book I take to read. Every book gives birth to special inner world in my mind and in my soul. I like to imagine main characters of my favourite book, their cloths and faces and it's always difficult for me to leave the characters of my favourite novel in the end of the book.

As for me, good literature develop imagination, logical thinking, broader one's outlook, makes people more educated and give a chance to develop. One famous writer said that books are our friends. I completely agree with him. It seems to me that books take an important please in our life and they are necessary for everybody.

As for me I have read a lot of different books, but I can't mark out one special book. But there are some which impressed me more. First of all it is Noter Dame de Paris, then Jane Air, Angelica, little prince, detective stories of Conan Doyle, Dracula by Bram Stoker and many others.

I think that reading books helped me to become more educated, helped to learn a lot of interesting things, enreached my vocabulary. As one proverb says ""man cannot live on bread alone"". Books are the source of knowledge and the means of self-perfection."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Books can fit almost every need, temper, or interest. Bookscan be read when you are in the mood; you don't need to do it all the time. Books are both more personal and more impersonalthan professors. Books have an inner confidence which individualsseldom show; they rarely have to be on the defensive. Books canafford to be bold, and courageous, and explanatory; they don'thave to be so careful of boards of trustees, colleagues, andcommunity opinion. Books are infinitely diverse; they run thegamut of all human activities. Books can express every point of view;if you need a different point of view, you can read a differentbook. Reading is probably the most important skill you needfor successful studies. You will have to read lengthyassignments in different subjects with varying degrees of detailand difficulty. If you you read inaccuratley, you will fail tounderstand some of the information and ideas you read. If youread slowly, you will have to spent too much time reading yourassignments and the rest of your work may suffer.

Poor reading may be a problem for you, but it can be solved. Like other skills, your abilty to read Englishfast and accurately demands careful instruction andpurposeful practice. You must keep practising on your own toimprove your reading skills."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"In Greece and Rome the earliest books were written on tablets of wood or pieces of bark covered with wax, and writing was possible upon them with a small stick called ""stylus"". In Assyria and Babylonia clay tablets were used for writing and the words were drawn with a piece of wood. After baking, the tablets were kept on shelves. They were long-lasting and some of them survived until the present day.

The earliest books of the ancient world were written on papyrus and skins of young animals. These books took the form of a long strip, roiled from one cylinder to another. Though paper has been known in China since the first century, the secret of papermaking came to Europe much later.

Books were popular in ancient Rome: there were many booksellers and the first public library was founded there about 39 B.C.1 Only the rich could buy books or make their slaves copy books from important libraries. 
By the time, of the Middle Ages all books were handwritten, beautifully decorated, but they were often chained to the shelves. But only few people could read them.

,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"First printing was invented in China and by the end of the 15th century there were more than 200 presses in Europe . The early printers were not only craftsmen but also editors, publishers and booksellers. The first printing, press in England was set up by William Caxton at Westminster in 1476. and the first printing press in Russia — by Ivan Fedorov in Moscow in 1564.

Early libraries were used only by scientists but latery they were used by the public. In the 19th century a proper system of public libraries appeared. Now most countries have their own national libraries. 
Many old university libraries have rich collections of books: Oxford and Cambridge in England, Harvard and Yale in the United States.
Among the great libraries of the world we can name the British Museum Library (the British Library) in London, the Library of Congress in the United States, it's the world's largest Library, Bibliotheque Nationale in France , the Beijing Library in China, the State Public Library in Moscow. 
Modern libraries do their best to help people get information as quickly as possible. They use computers and electronic catalogues.Probably the most difficult problem for any library is to keep their books, journals and films."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"D. Defoe (1660—1731) was a great master of realistic detail. The novel ""Robinson Crusoe"" was written in 1719. The novel is praise to human labour and the triumph of man over nature. Defoe shows the development of his hero. At the beginning of the story we see an unexperienced youth, a rather frivolous boy, who then becomes a strong-willed man.

Robinson Crusoe's most characteristic trait is his optimism. His guiding principle in life become ""never say die"" and ""in trouble to be troubled is to have your troubles doubled"". He had confidence in himself and in man. He believed it was within the power of man to overcome all difficulties. Crusoe was an enthusiastic worker and always hoped for the best.

Defoe is a writer of the Enlightenment. He teaches people how to live, he tries to teach what's good and what's bad.

His novel ""Robinson Crusoe"" is not only a work of fiction, an account of adventures, a biography and an educational pamphlet. It is a study of man, a great work showing man in relation to nature and civilization as well as in relation to labour and private property."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"This is probably one of the book that I know the length and the breadth of it. I don't remember how many times I've re-reread it. I've watched all the most popular screen version of the novel. It doesn't depend on movie format it can be a full motion film or a soap opera.

This creation by Jane Austen has had lots of admirers all over the world for almost two hundred years. Many famous and outstanding literature personalities were followers and fans of this book and Jane Austen's works in general.

I've read the book from cover to cover. And I'm sure I'll do it again. I was so crazy about it that I re-read it in original translation. It was quite difficult, but when I finished I felt a satisfaction that I didn't give up without a fight at the beginning, when I faced enormous amount of unclear words.

I like reading this book first of all because of well-drawn people's characters. Every next re-reading I always find something brand new that I've not noted previous time. This is the false mirror of people's soles and weaknesses that help to see clear common mistakes in behavior of main characters. It's a kind of a reference book how we shouldn't conduct if we really want to be a respectful and an honorable person. At the same time the novels help to broaden our outlook. A social status of women in comparison with men is reflected in the book. The book is full of sharp satire towards the disadvantages of the education between a swell society and sidesmen.

Some characters make feel feelings of sympathy, another ones arose misunderstanding in a way of their conduct.

The father's appreciate only two oldest one and doesn't mind about others and hides from all the life problems in his library. Permissiveness and lack of education get their results at the end.

Author focuses our attention on love stories of two eldest sisters. During all book every event links with them. Mistakes and winnings of their relatives hurt or help two young ladies achieve the most desirable goal in life - to get married happily. Some may think that this is a chick lit. but there is an intelligent and a hidden meaning in characters dialogues. How much wit some of them shows to hide misbehave of precious to the people. Especially I love that part when main heroes made hard attempts to change themselves to correct offences which they've done. They don't just apologize, they support each other in the most difficult moments , they don't wait for approving of actions and do all their best.

Definitely there is a happy ending because main characters have recognized and regret their sins. And even didn't wait for forgiveness but after all get the most expensive treasure. They've made such a long way from hatred to understanding each other even without a word. This is a conformation of proverb 'from love to hate one step' only from another side."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"William Somerset Maugham's short stories are very fascinating.Not long ago I've read one of his short stories, it is the storyabout a man who is very rich, very powerful, very intellegent,very successful in his career and yet he is unhappy. Hisname is Lord Mountdrago (the story says: he was an able anddistinguished man who was appointed Secretary of Foreign Affairswhen he was under forty. He was considered the most capablepolitican in the Conservative Party and for a long time directedthe foreign policy of his country). One day he comes to Dr.Audlin who is a psychotherapist and whose reputation as apsychotherapist is very good. Dr. Audlin seems to be able to helpalmost everybody (the story says: he could relief certain pains bythe touch of his cool, soft hands and by talking to his patients,often induced sleep in those who were suffering from sleeplessness. He spoke slowly. His voice had no particularcolor, but it was musical, soft and lulling. Dr. Audlin foundthat by speaking to people in that low monotonous voice of his,by looking at them with his pale, quiet eyes, by stroking theirforeheads with his long firm hands he could sometimes do thingsthat seemed miraculous). Lord Mountdrago had a strange dreams.They get on his nerves. And he was afraid that he will go mad orcommit suicide if it would go on like that every night. He said thathis decision can affect the welfare of the country. When Dr.Audlin askes to describe one of his dreams, he begins: ""the first dreamI had was about a month ago. I dreamt that i was at a party atConnemara House. It was an official party. The King and the Queenwere to be there and many prominent people too. Suddenly I saw alittle man there called Owen Griffiths, who is a member ofparlament from the Labour Party and to tell you the truth, I wassurprised to see him there. The Connemaras were at the top of amarble staircase receiving their guests... Suddenly I noticedthat the King and the Queen had come, turned my back on theConnemaras and understood that I had got my trousers on. You can'tunderstand what i felt at that moment, an agony of shame. I awokein a cold sweat and understood what it was only a dream"".
"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,Dr. Audlin can't diagnose the case and soon he learns that Lord Mountrago has ruined his opponent in the House of Commons.Whose name is Owen Griffiths. He did it cruelly and mercilessly. Hisconscience protested that injury he caused to Griffiths. Thestory has a tragic end. Lord Mountdrago is unable to get rid ofhis terrible dreams. He commits suicide. His antagonist suddenlydies too. The newspaper wrote that his death was supposed to bedue to natural reason but we know that his death wassupernaturally conditioned by Lord Mountdrago's tragic end. Inconclusion we come to after having read that supernational forceseffect our lives. No matter how sensitive or insensitive we mightbe to them. Thus the moral of the story is that doing good is theonly certainly happy action of a man's life.
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Libraries play an important part in the cultural development of a country. People have a desire to learn, they seek knowledge. Books satisfy this desire.

Books should not be read only for pleasure. Reading books helps us in our education. We can find all kinds of books in the libraries: novels, biographies, fiction, short stories, books on travelling, technical books, magazines, books for children and so on. In some libraries we can find books in many foreign languages.

When a reader comes to a library for the first time, he fills in his library card and the librarian helps him to choose something to read. The reader is allowed to borrow books for a certain number of days. The catalogues help the reader to find the books he needs. We should be careful with the books and not damage them in any way. We should not make notes in library books or dogs-ear the pages. Reading rooms are open to all who wish to work there. Besides books we can get periodicals, newspaper files and magazines to read there. Readers come to reading rooms to study and prepare material for their reports or for their scientific work."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"My favourite book is «Robinson Crusoe» by Daniel Defoe. D. Defoe (1660—1731) was a great master of realistic detail. The novel «Robinson Crusoe» was written in 1719. The novel is praise to human labour and the triumph of man over nature. Defoe shows the development of his hero. At the beginning of the story we see an unexperienced youth, a rather frivolous boy, who then becomes a strong-willed man.
Robinson Crusoe’s most characteristic trait is his optimism. His guiding principle in life become «never say die» and «in trouble to be troubled is to have your troubles doubled» He had confidence in himself and in man. He believed it was within the power of man to overcome all difficulties. Crusoe was an enthusiastic worker and always hoped for the best.

Defoe is a writer of the Enlightenment. He teaches people how to live, he tries to teach what’s good and what’s bad.
His novel «Robinson Crusoe» is not only a work of fiction, an account of adventures, a biography and an educational pamphlet. It is a study of man, a great work showing man in relation to nature and civilization as well as in relation to labour and private property."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"A book is one of the greatest wonders of world. Why are so many people fond of reading? The world of books is full of wonders. Together with the characters of books you can find yourself in different and countries, have a lot of adventures. The book is a faithful friend. They form our values and characters. We try to look like the characters of your favourite books: to be brave, honest, not to be silly and greedy, to be real friends. We enjoyed the beauty and wisdom of fairy-tales and fables when we were babies and Granny read them. They taught us to be kind, clever, hardworking, to understand other people and help them. They teach us to understand the beauty of nature, take care of it, to love our homeland.
Books have been with us since childhood. Who hasn’t read «Alice in the wonderland», «Mowgli»? Who hasn’t travelled with Marry Poppins to her imaginary world? Who hasn’t imagined himself to be Robinson Crusoe on the deserted island?
I have read a lot of interesting books, but my favourite book is «The adventures of Tom Sawyer» by Mark Twain. This well-known book is popular with the children all over the world.
The main character of the book is Tom Sawyer, who lived in a small town on the Mississippi River. He was a boy with a wild imagination. He and his friends often dreamed of different adventures. Tom was naughty, kind and brave. Besides he was noble. I like this boy because he teaches us to be true friends.
If you are not fond of reading, take a book to your liking or borrow it from the library and read it. Books are worth reading. Readly, they are our good friends."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"My favorite book is Panchatantra. It is written by Vishnu Sharma. The book contains a collection of many stories. The writer has tried to give the moral of life by the activity of animals. I am very fond of reading storybooks and this book provided me with different types of stories.

The story of stork and crab shows the presence of the mind and intelligence of the crab. The stork could not search for his food when he became old and therefore had made a plan. He stood sad and depressed near the pond and when fish and crab asked the reason for his sadness, he made a fake story that the pond will be inhabited by people to grow crops. All the fishes, frogs, and crabs were convinced by his story. Later when it was the chance of crab to be killed and eaten by the stork, the situation was reversed. Crab used his intelligence and could guess the real motive of the stork. He escaped by killing the stork.

The book contains several stories like Monkey and crocodile, Elephant and mice, loyal mongoose, etc. There are many stories in the book and they focus on the qualities like friendship, courage, intelligence, presence of mind, and unity.
The book Panchatantra is one of my favorite storybooks. I was very happy after reading this book for the first time. The stories are fascinating as well as teach us some morals of life."

Elucidation of My Favourite Book

My favorite book is Mahabharata. I did not know anything about this epic before I read the book. I received this book as my birthday gift from my grandparents. At first, when I opened the book, it appeared to be a little boring. I kept the book as it is in my drawer. Later when the serial Mahabharata was casted on television, I started getting interested in the story. Since it was casted a little on one day and I wanted to know about the whole story soon. Therefore I started reading the book.

Mahabharata is one of the major epics of Hindus in Sanskrit. It has been written by Maharishi Ved Vyas. The epic contains 10000 shlokas. The main story depicted by this epic is based on the battle between Pandavas and Kauravas for getting the throne of Hastinapur. The battle was fought in Kurukshetra.
"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"The book mainly focuses on the story of Kauravas and Pandavas. Dhritarashtra and Pandu were two brothers. Since Dhritarashtra was blind so Pandu became the ruler. Duryodhana was the eldest of hundred sons (Kaurwas) of Dhritarashtra and Yudhistir, Bheem, Arjuna, Nakul, and Sehdev were five sons of Pandu. Duryodhana invited Pandavas to play the game with him. The Pandavas accepted the offer of their cousin's brother and came to play. They lost the game and also Draupadi called “Panchali”.

As a result, they have to spend 13 years of exile period. After they completed the period of exile, they returned to Indraprastha. Duryodhana refused to hand over Hastinapur to Pandavas. This led them to fight the battle for justice and dharma. Later the Pandavas won the battle by defeating Kauravas.

Bhagavad Gita - Arjun was not ready to fight the battle against his close relatives. The Enlightenment and knowledge which Lord Krishna imparted during the battle to Arjun came to be known as Bhagavad Gita. It is the storehouse of knowledge. It is part of the Great Epic Mahabharata.

It consists of 18 chapters consisting of 700 shlokas. It teaches us spiritual lessons along with important lessons of life.

Lord Krishna says that it is the body only that dies not the soul. The soul leaves one body and occupies a new body. It has been explained in Gita that one should be hard working without thinking of the results. There is no substitute for hard work. The life of man is full of struggles and men should face all these with a firm determination.

Conclusion

I love the story of Mahabharata. This book helps us in solving the problems of our life. In the story of Mahabharata, every character has an important role and we can learn different things from their life."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Reading books is a good habit. It inculcates knowledge and moral values in us. Every one of us should have a good reading habit. Books are like our companions. Books are the storehouse of knowledge and we can obtain the knowledge to develop a passion for reading us.

I have read many books. I am very fond of reading novels and storybooks. My favorite book is Ramayana. It is the greatest Epic after Mahabharata written by Rishi Valmiki. It is the holy book of Hindus."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"The great epic Ramayana illustrates the story of Lord Rama. He was the son of Ayodhya King Dasharatha. King Dasharatha had four sons from his three wives namely Ram, Lakshman, Bharata, Shatrughan. There was a lot of love and affection between the brothers.

All four of them left Ayodhya the first time to gain an education. They completed their education and returned to Ayodhya. Further, they all were married. Lord Ram was married to Sita. Lord Ram has to leave his family and go to exile for a period of 14 years, following the orders of his mother Kaikeyi. He left to spend his exile period with his wife Sita and brother Lakshman.

In the jungle, Sita was kidnapped by the Demon King Ravana. Lord Ram defeated Ravana and rescued his wife back to Ayodhya. Then only Ram was conferred as King of Ayodhya. He saved the lives of many saints by punishing the evil characters. He was the ideal king for his people of kingdom Ayodhya. He took care of his people and sometimes went into the public by changing his identity to know the real scenario. He would hear to everybody in his kingdom and did justice."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Lesson from the Life of Different Characters of Ramayana

Lord Ram - He was an ideal son for his father, mother, and country, ideal husband for his wife Sita, an Ideal brother, and Ideal king for the public of his kingdom.
Lakshman - He was an Ideal brother and took care of his elder brother Ram. All of the brothers had a lot of love and affection for each other.
Bharata - He was an ideal brother. It has been stated that when Lord Ram went to exile for 14 years, Bharata has kept the slippers of his elder brother on the throne and did not accept the throne as a king. He also had sacrificed the pleasures of the palace and resided in a small hut. These things represent the respect and love of a brother.
Sita - Lord Ram was married to Sita. She was an ideal wife. She went along with Lord Ram for the exile period. She stated that - How could a wife enjoy all pleasures of life when the husband has to go for exile period? She always stood with her husband in good or bad times of life.
Shabri - Her character is also an important character as a great Devotee of Ram. She spread the flowers and selected berries daily to welcome Lord Ram and finally her wish was fulfilled. In the same way, we should not lose hope till the end and try our best.
All other characters were also great like Hanuman the greatest devotee of Lord Ram, all the mothers of Lord Ram, wife of all four brothers, Jatayu, etc."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Moral Derived after Reading the Book

We must be brave and courageous in our life with a high spirit.
Life has both phases i.e. happiness and grief. We must be readily accepting both phases of life.
This epic teaches us to respect our elders and teachers. We should listen and follow what they say.
We learn that evil or wrong deeds never give a better result. We should use our energy in a positive direction to achieve success. As the demon Ravana took away Maa Sita by betrayal, therefore, was punished. Instead of being a person with intellect, he did not use his mind and energy in a positive direction.
Conclusion

Ramayana is an epic with immense knowledge and principles of life. This book can be found in every house. I love reading this book again and again. People who do not have this book must bring and read the book as it is filled with spiritual and moral lessons."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Q.1 What is the root word of the book?

,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Books are always considered as the best friend. Books give us knowledge and cheer us up in despair.


 
My favourite book is ‘The Gita’. It is a holy book. It consists of the ‘shlokas’ which give us useful lessons. It was presented to me by my father.

It is a true guide of mankind. Whenever a person is in trouble, it gives him peace and strength. It is a source of knowledge, wisdom, and light. It is a gift to mankind from the god himself."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"“Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested”

As Francis Bacon has so aptly said, there are different categories of books. There are books that are to be read purely for entertainment and there are those which offer a profound comment on life itself. It is this latter category of books which interest me a great deal. There are, of course, innumerable books of this kind. However, my favourite book is ‘Great Expectations by Charles Dickens.

‘Great Expectations’ is the story of a little boy, Pip, who begins his life in the country, suddenly acquires wealth and moves to the city, and begins to look down on the country. He rises in life and society, but along with this, his moral values degenerate. Later, he passes through a series of experiences that make him realize the false values he has acquired. He then goes back to his birthplace, abandons his false expectations, and shows his maturity in accepting the limitations of his condition."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Through the story of Pip, Dickens exposes the various evils of society. He was particularly concerned about the plight of ill-treated children. Thus, he shows us how Magwitch (the convict) began his life by stealing vegetables (“turnips”) to satisfy his hunger. He is caught, tried, punished, and once again left to fend for himself, instead of being given any help to rehabilitate himself. He thus has no option but to once again steal and gradually becomes a criminal. Pip is an orphan and is severely ill-treated by his sister. Even visitors to their house abuse him and look at him as a virtual criminal.

Dickens exposes the irresponsibility and injustice of the law. Magwitch is condemned by the judge as a “Scourge to society” and sentenced to death. We feel outraged at the treatment meted out to him because he had fully redeemed himself by earning money through honest means.

Apart from the inhumanity of the law, we are shown the extent of inhumanity to which human beings can descend. Miss Harisham has been deserted by her lover and seeks to wreak revenge on all men. She therefore adopts and brings up a pretty little girl Estella, and teaches her to have a heart of stone and be cruel to men who are attracted to her. Estella, accordingly, does torment all the young boys who come in contact with her, particularly Pip."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Dickens further gives us an insight into the vanity of human nature. Pip, once he acquires wealth and education spends all his money on clothes, furnishings, parties, and cards, with no intellectual or artistic activity to his credit. He begins to look down on Joe, (who was the only one who had ever given him the affection of both, a father and a mother). Again, he feels degraded when he finds that he owed his progress to a convict, Magwitch. Instead of being grateful, he can only feel repulsed by Magwitch’s affectionate advances.

While thus exposing the evils of society and the vanity of human nature, Dickens also shows us the positive aspects of society and human nature. Thus, there is Joe, who even though he is looked down upon and insulted by Pip, yet does not give him up. On the other hand, he helps Pip out of his debts by paying off his creditors and looks after him through his sickness. Then there is Magwitch who repays Pip’s aid (who as a child had stolen food and a file to cut his iron chains under the threat of being killed by the convict if he refused) amply, by spending all his money (earned during his exile) on Pip’s education. Finally, there is Pip himself, who at last comes to appreciate the good heart of Magwitch and visits him in prison in his last moments without feeling ashamed. He also realizes his ill-conduct to-wards Joe and expresses his sorrow at it."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Thus, Great Expectations is a book that can be read again and again, and each reading further adds to one’s understanding of the various themes. Finally, what appeals to me most about it, is that the truths that Dickens exposes are not limited to his time but hold true to this day.

It changed my vision, my perspective, and my motive of life. Let me tell you how all that happened. First of let’s talk about how this holy book came to us. It was almost 1450 years ago, it came to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). 

Allah sent it to his part by part. This book is unchanged and still carrying the same content. The most surprising thing is that it still can be a guide for the ultimate good life after 14 hundreds of years. That’s why Islamic scholars tell ‘the Quran is the perfect solution for life’. Whatever we need to learn, solve, or think everything has been discussed in the Quran. 

There was an open challenge for mankind if they make a similar chapter of the Quran. But it’s not possible to write. Because this book has come directly from the Almighty Allah. It wasn’t written by any human. "

This book contains a story named a person ‘Robinson’ who lived on an island for 28 years. He fell in a ship accident and lost everything. Then he found a boat to drive to the nearest island. It was a huge island. 

He made his own kingdom there. He collected his food by taming animals and growing some crops. He became a permanent member of the island. Some day he faced something brutal and different. He found a man was naked brought to the island by some cannibals. "
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"He rescued the person and gave him the name ‘Friday’. Friday became his partner but he was also a member of cannibals. That’s why Robinson kept him outside of his tent. 

Then Friday became the partner of Robinson and they both made the island an amazing place for themselves. In the end, a ship came to their island and there was lots of adventure and stories that will make you feel thrilled. "

It teaches how to keep yourself focused when you are alone and under lots of problems. This story is about how a man creates his own reality. When Robinson found Friday and he became the best companion for him.

Make a shortlist of your favorite books first. It’s better to pick top 10 books first. And then write which book has what types of impact of your real life and on your thinking. That’s how you will come with your favorite book. And then write what this book taught you and be able to teach the same someone else.

It is a very amazing fiction that was loved by millions of young people in the world. There is a movie series too based on this story. I love this book because of its mind-blowing story and few interesting characters. "
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"It's hard to imagine our lives without books. We learn a lot of interesting things when we read books. Books are our great friend, teachers and advisers. They teach us how to take the next step when we are in a difficult situation. They help to shape our life. It is impossible to become an educated person without books. Besides, books play an important role in upbringing our feelings, views and tastes; give us a lot of useful information. Frankly speaking I'm not a bookworm but when I have spare time I read books with great pleasure. It seems to me that books are a source of emotional inspiration and romantic feelings, it's a miracle in some way, because an author provides a story and a reader can conjure the characters
Books are worth reading. Really, they are our good friends.

My favourite book

Most teenagers have different opinions on reading. As for me, I think reading is very important, because books help to discover new things, to learn more about life. Also books tell us about lives of famous people and other interesting things.

The book I`m reading now is ""Twilight"" by Stephanie Meyer. Stephanie Meyer is a modern American writer. She was born in 1973 in Hartford, Connecticut. She grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, along with two sisters and three brothers. ""Twilight"" is a novel about vampires, written by Stephanie Meyer. The main characters of the novel are a vampire and the girl dreamed author in a dream... It is a Vampire novel, the first edition of which only in the United States broke up a record run of 100 000 copies! The book, which became a cult for youth not only in English-speaking countries, but in France, Spain, Scandinavia, Japan and China.

The plot of this book has described on how Bella Swan moves from sunny Phoenix to rainy Forks, Washington, to his father, Charlie. On the first day of the new school Bella sees a strange, very beautiful family Cullen. Bella is very interested in this family, especially in Edward.

At the first lesson at Biology, plant for one party with Edward. Bell struck by the fact that he looks at her with an incomprehensible hatred. As soon as the bell rings, he runs out of the class, and the next few days does not appear in the school.

This is because is the novel grasps your attention from the beginning to the end, and I believe that as an Equity Researcher this is what needs to occur in the reports in addition to when speaking with clients and the sales team. I enjoyed reading every page. A book that narrates to what means a husband and father is supposed to go for what he believes is right and especially to protect his loved one. Moreover, it depicts how a man, left on his own, abandoned to his fate with will and persistence can make the most of a situation that many may classify as doomed. The book illustrates also how someone can change over time. Piet Hoffman is an ex-con who currently works for the Swedish police as an infiltrator to uncover Polish gangsters, putting himself in danger to get to the bottom of their organised crime. Related to business terms, this can be seen with the revamping of companies that are in distress, but that with a second opportunity can prosper. An example that comes to my mind is with the luxury fashionwear brand Moncler. Once, on the edge of bankruptcy and now one of the most iconic brands with a market capitalisation of approximately 6.16 billion euros."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Knowing a person’s favorite book could give some insight into who they are and what they are like. For example, knowing that a person’s favorite book is The Art of War by Sun Tzu could mean that the person is competitive or aggressive. A reader’s favorite book can range from many different time periods in their life, as well as, many different genres. Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, a book I read in my teenage years, is my favorite books. This is my favorite book due to the many different meaningful quotes used, the insanity of the main character, and the theme of the protection of innocence. A quotation is a way the author addresses a topic without directly saying what he or she means. In Catcher in the Rye, Salinger uses many different meaningful quotations that influence readers to stop and think. For example, in chapter 12, the main character states, “People always clap for the wrong things.” Humans live in a “monkey see monkey do” world, which means that if one person does something everyone is going to try to do the same thing, no matter if the thing is good or bad. Salinger included the quote about clapping for the wrong things to open society’s eyes and help people realize that maybe they do things not because they enjoy them, but because they see other people do them. Another meaningful quotation comes from chapter 24. The quote states, “The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"When you’re taking a literature course, you clearly expect some degree of academic writing to be involved. You’ll be reading books, and you’ll be discussing them in class. However, you’ll also analyze those books in written.
There’s a problem: your professors assign you the books and they ask you to write the paper, but they don’t teach you how to write a literary essay step by step. Some students assume they can find some reviews on Goodreads and paraphrase them. Others go through blogs maintained by passionate readers, and they assume that that’s the style they should follow.
This type of paper needs a specific format. Plus, you’ll have to maintain an adequate style of academic writing. You can’t write like a blogger would write, and you cannot copy Goodreads or Amazon reviews. What you should do is read that book and write a proper literary essay that would leave your professor impressed.
Are there any guidelines you can follow to achieve that goal? Of course there are! In the most basic form, these are the steps you should follow:
Understand the purpose of a literary analysis;
Understand the format (learn what this type of assignment must include in its content);
Plan
Write
Edit
Sounds pretty simple, doesn’t it? As any other student, you need more tangible guidelines that teach you how to handle this particular assignment. As always, we’re here to help with that! Read through this step-by-step guide, and you’ll be ready to start writing the literary analysis by the end of the day."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"The main purpose of a literary analysis essay is to prove that you’ve carefully examined and evaluated a work of literature from various aspects. First of all, you must understand the term analysis. It means breaking something up to its essential components, and analyzing how their features contribute towards the overall impression.
Let’s take an example: you’re analyzing Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. It’s a highly popular book with countless reviews all over the Internet. If you check out those reviews, you’ll notice they are highly personal. They are all about the way the reader perceived the book. You’re allowed to share your own impressions in a literary analysis, but they have to be part of a more structured format. Most of all, you’ll focus on the analysis of all components of the book.
You’ll be reading the book differently, too. When you’re reading for pleasure, you’re mainly focused on emotions and visualizations of the scenes and characters. You’ll still pay attention to those elements of the reading process, but you’ll also be analytical towards the book. You’ll consider these elements:
Subject
Form
Style
Main theme
The relationship between form and content
The relationship between the main plot and the subplot
Characters’ strengths and flaws
Storyline strengths and flaws
In most cases, professors ask you to focus on one aspect analyzing a book. For example, they will ask you to analyze the strengths and flaws of Gatsby’s character. An overall analysis is a much larger and more complex paper, whose structure is closer to a research paper than it is to an essay."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"The purpose of a literary analysis is to analyze a particular theme or aspect of the book or poem you’ve read.
Your writing will be sharp and focused. You will express not only your personal thoughts and emotions regarding the piece, but your studious approach towards it as well.
Think of it this way: you’re putting yourself in the shoes of a literary critic. If you’ve ever read the critiques in popular magazines, you’ll notice they are objective; not personal. Your essay will have a specific format, but it will maintain that critical approach you’ve seen from real critics.
Your goal is to convince the reader that you’re making a valid point with your analysis
"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"When students don’t know how to write a literary essay, they make a common mistake: freewriting. This assignment is not based on freewriting, where you sit and write whatever comes to mind regarding the book. The paper must be organized, and it needs specific elements that will turn freewriting into an actual literary analysis:
A specific topic, which you’ll formulate in accordance with the central idea you want to convey.
A central thesis statement, which tells the reader what to expect from the rest of the paper. This is a very clear declarative sentence that conveys the main point of your essay. Every single sentence you write in your literary analysis will be directly connected to this central idea.
An introduction, body, and conclusion - that’s the basic structure to maintain in most formats of academic writing. The literary analysis is no different; it needs an intro, body, and conclusion. The only difference is that you’re not obliged to stick to the 5-paragraph format. If you need more paragraphs in the body, you’re free to include them unless your professor tells you otherwise."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Now that you’re aware of all elements this essay should include, it’s easier for you to write the literary essay outline. It should briefly describe the points you’re going to include in the introduction, body, and conclusion. Once you have the outline ready, it will be easier for you to start writing the paper.
How do you start? That’s the greatest challenge to overcome throughout this process.
In the introduction, it’s important to capture the interest of your reader. You will do that by bringing immediate focus to the main point you’re going to make. Explain the reader (your professor) what aspect of the book or poem you’re going to analyze. Is it the format, a specific character, or an element of the plot?
You may start with a quote that conveys this main point for you. If, for example, you’re analyzing Gatsby’s character, you may include this quote:
“If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ‘creative temperament’ - it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which is not likely I shall ever find again.”"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"With this quote, the author practically expressed Gatsby’s personality, so you have where to start from. From here on, you’ll analyze the character’s personality in different scenes and you’ll describe how they are related to the description from this quote.
It’s also allowed for you to include some background information relevant to the literature genre or to the author of the piece you’re analyzing.
At the end of the introduction, you’ll include your thesis statement. It’s recommended for it to be in a single sentence. That rule will push you towards clarity and scarcity.
Once you have the introduction with a clear thesis statement, it won’t be that difficult for you to write the body of your paper. You don’t necessarily have to write three paragraphs in it, but it’s the minimum number of paragraphs for an essay of 500 - 700 words. You may separate the body in more paragraphs, but less than three would make the paper look like a bulky and overwhelming read.
Each paragraph needs a topic sentence, which is directly related to the thesis statement."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"Naturally, your literary analysis needs a strong, convincing conclusion. This final paragraph will make the essay complete and well-rounded. It will give the reader an impression that you made a clear point that they are ready to agree or disagree with.
How do you write such a conclusion?
Don’t introduce new points of discussion in the conclusion.
It should summarize and restate the main points you made, but it mustn’t be repetitive. You may make a relevant comment from a different perspective, or restate the main thesis to show how your arguments proved it."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"The literary analysis is not an easy essay to write. They say that the best critics are geniuses. They know how to penetrate deep into the essence of the book they read, and understand the author’s intentions for each element of their writing.
No one expects a college student to achieve that level of literary criticism, but the least you can do is try. If you follow the tips above, you can start writing the literary analysis essay as soon as you’re done with the reading."

,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"OLIVER SACKS, THE MIND’S EYE (2010)

Toward the end of his life, maybe suspecting or sensing that it was coming to a close, Dr. Oliver Sacks tended to focus his efforts on sweeping intellectual projects like On the Move (a memoir), The River of Consciousness (a hybrid intellectual history), and Hallucinations (a book-length meditation on, what else, hallucinations). But in 2010, he gave us one more classic in the style that first made him famous, a form he revolutionized and brought into the contemporary literary canon: the medical case study as essay. In The Mind’s Eye, Sacks focuses on vision, expanding the notion to embrace not only how we see the world, but also how we map that world onto our brains when our eyes are closed and we’re communing with the deeper recesses of consciousness. Relaying histories of patients and public figures, as well as his own history of ocular cancer (the condition that would eventually spread and contribute to his death), Sacks uses vision as a lens through which to see all of what makes us human, what binds us together, and what keeps us painfully apart. The essays that make up this collection are quintessential Sacks: sensitive, searching, with an expertise that conveys scientific information and experimentation in terms we can not only comprehend, but which also expand how we see life carrying on around us. The case studies of “Stereo Sue,” of the concert pianist Lillian Kalir, and of Howard, the mystery novelist who can no longer read, are highlights of the collection, but each essay is a kind of gem, mined and polished by one of the great storytellers of our era.  –Dwyer Murphy, CrimeReads Managing Editor"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"JOHN JEREMIAH SULLIVAN, PULPHEAD (2011)

The American essay was having a moment at the beginning of the decade, and Pulphead was smack in the middle. Without any hard data, I can tell you that this collection of John Jeremiah Sullivan’s magazine features—published primarily in GQ, but also in The Paris Review, and Harper’s—was the only full book of essays most of my literary friends had read since Slouching Towards Bethlehem, and probably one of the only full books of essays they had even heard of. 
Well, we all picked a good one. Every essay in Pulphead is brilliant and entertaining, and illuminates some small corner of the American experience—even if it’s just one house, with Sullivan and an aging writer inside (“Mr. Lytle” is in fact a standout in a collection with no filler; fittingly, it won a National Magazine Award and a Pushcart Prize). But what are they about? Oh, Axl Rose, Christian Rock festivals, living around the filming of One Tree Hill, the Tea Party movement, Michael Jackson, Bunny Wailer, the influence of animals, and by god, the Miz (of Real World/Road Rules Challenge fame).

But as Dan Kois has pointed out, what connects these essays, apart from their general tone and excellence, is “their author’s essential curiosity about the world, his eye for the perfect detail, and his great good humor in revealing both his subjects’ and his own foibles.” They are also extremely well written, drawing much from fictional techniques and sentence craft, their literary pleasures so acute and remarkable that James Wood began his review of the collection in The New Yorker with a quiz: “Are the following sentences the beginnings of essays or of short stories?” (It was not a hard quiz, considering the context.)

It’s hard not to feel, reading this collection, like someone reached into your brain, took out the half-baked stuff you talk about with your friends, researched it, lived it, and represented it to you smarter and better and more thoroughly than you ever could. So read it in awe if you must, but read it.  –Emily Temple, Senior Editor"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"ALEKSANDAR HEMON, THE BOOK OF MY LIVES (2013)

Such is the sentence-level virtuosity of Aleksandar Hemon—the Bosnian-American writer, essayist, and critic—that throughout his career he has frequently been compared to the granddaddy of borrowed language prose stylists: Vladimir Nabokov. While it is, of course, objectively remarkable that anyone could write so beautifully in a language they learned in their twenties, what I admire most about Hemon’s work is the way in which he infuses every essay and story and novel with both a deep humanity and a controlled (but never subdued) fury. He can also be damn funny. Hemon grew up in Sarajevo and left in 1992 to study in Chicago, where he almost immediately found himself stranded, forced to watch from afar as his beloved home city was subjected to a relentless four-year bombardment, the longest siege of a capital in the history of modern warfare. This extraordinary memoir-in-essays is many things: it’s a love letter to both the family that raised him and the family he built in exile; it’s a rich, joyous, and complex portrait of a place the 90s made synonymous with war and devastation; and it’s an elegy for the wrenching loss of precious things. There’s an essay about coming of age in Sarajevo and another about why he can’t bring himself to leave Chicago. There are stories about relationships forged and maintained on the soccer pitch or over the chessboard, and stories about neighbors and mentors turned monstrous by ethnic prejudice. As a chorus they sing with insight, wry humor, and unimaginable sorrow. I am not exaggerating when I say that the collection’s devastating final piece, “The Aquarium”—which details his infant daughter’s brain tumor and the agonizing months which led up to her death—remains the most painful essay I have ever read.  –Dan Sheehan, Book Marks Editor"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"ROBIN WALL KIMMERER, BRAIDING SWEETGRASS (2013)

Of every essay in my relentlessly earmarked copy of Braiding Sweetgrass, Dr. Robin Wall Kimmerer’s gorgeously rendered argument for why and how we should keep going, there’s one that especially hits home: her account of professor-turned-forester Franz Dolp. When Dolp, several decades ago, revisited the farm that he had once shared with his ex-wife, he found a scene of destruction: The farm’s new owners had razed the land where he had tried to build a life. “I sat among the stumps and the swirling red dust and I cried,” he wrote in his journal.

So many in my generation (and younger) feel this kind of helplessness–and considerable rage–at finding ourselves newly adult in a world where those in power seem determined to abandon or destroy everything that human bodies have always needed to survive: air, water, land. Asking any single book to speak to this helplessness feels unfair, somehow; yet, Braiding Sweetgrass does, by weaving descriptions of indigenous tradition with the environmental sciences in order to show what survival has looked like over the course of many millennia. Kimmerer’s essays describe her personal experience as a Potawotami woman, plant ecologist, and teacher alongside stories of the many ways that humans have lived in relationship to other species. Whether describing Dolp’s work–he left the stumps for a life of forest restoration on the Oregon coast–or the work of others in maple sugar harvesting, creating black ash baskets, or planting a Three Sisters garden of corn, beans, and squash, she brings hope. “In ripe ears and swelling fruit, they counsel us that all gifts are multiplied in relationship,” she writes of the Three Sisters, which all sustain one another as they grow. “This is how the world keeps going.”  –Corinne Segal, Senior Editor"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"HILTON ALS, WHITE GIRLS (2013)

In a world where we are so often reduced to one essential self, Hilton Als’ breathtaking book of critical essays, White Girls, which meditates on the ways he and other subjects read, project and absorb parts of white femininity, is a radically liberating book. It’s one of the only works of critical thinking that doesn’t ask the reader, its author or anyone he writes about to stoop before the doorframe of complete legibility before entering. Something he also permitted the subjects and readers of his first book, the glorious book-length essay, The Women, a series of riffs and psychological portraits of Dorothy Dean, Owen Dodson, and the author’s own mother, among others. One of the shifts of that book, uncommon at the time, was how it acknowledges the way we inhabit bodies made up of variously gendered influences. To read White Girls now is to experience the utter freedom of this gift and to marvel at Als’ tremendous versatility and intelligence.

He is easily the most diversely talented American critic alive. He can write into genres like pop music and film where being part of an audience is a fantasy happening in the dark. He’s also wired enough to know how the art world builds reputations on the nod of rich white patrons, a significant collision in a time when Jean-Michel Basquiat is America’s most expensive modern artist. Als’ swerving and always moving grip on performance means he’s especially good on describing the effect of art which is volatile and unstable and built on the mingling of made-up concepts and the hard fact of their effect on behavior, such as race. Writing on Flannery O’Connor for instance he alone puts a finger on her “uneasy and unavoidable union between black and white, the sacred and the profane, the shit and the stars.” From Eminem to Richard Pryor, André Leon Talley to Michael Jackson, Als enters the life and work of numerous artists here who turn the fascinations of race and with whiteness into fury and song and describes the complexity of their beauty like his life depended upon it. There are also brief memoirs here that will stop your heart. This is an essential work to understanding American culture.  –John Freeman, Executive Editor"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"EULA BISS, ON IMMUNITY (2014)

We move through the world as if we can protect ourselves from its myriad dangers, exercising what little agency we have in an effort to keep at bay those fears that gather at the edges of any given life: of loss, illness, disaster, death. It is these fears—amplified by the birth of her first child—that Eula Biss confronts in her essential 2014 essay collection, On Immunity. As any great essayist does, Biss moves outward in concentric circles from her own very private view of the world to reveal wider truths, discovering as she does a culture consumed by anxiety at the pervasive toxicity of contemporary life. As Biss interrogates this culture—of privilege, of whiteness—she interrogates herself, questioning the flimsy ways in which we arm ourselves with science or superstition against the impurities of daily existence.

Five years on from its publication, it is dismaying that On Immunity feels as urgent (and necessary) a defense of basic science as ever. Vaccination, we learn, is derived from vacca—for cow—after the 17th-century discovery that a small application of cowpox was often enough to inoculate against the scourge of smallpox, an etymological digression that belies modern conspiratorial fears of Big Pharma and its vaccination agenda. But Biss never scolds or belittles the fears of others, and in her generosity and openness pulls off a neat (and important) trick: insofar as we are of the very world we fear, she seems to be suggesting, we ourselves are impure, have always been so, permeable, vulnerable, yet so much stronger than we think.  –Jonny Diamond, Editor-in-Chief "
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"REBECCA SOLNIT, THE MOTHER OF ALL QUESTIONS (2016)

When Rebecca Solnit’s essay, “Men Explain Things to Me,” was published in 2008, it quickly became a cultural phenomenon unlike almost any other in recent memory, assigning language to a behavior that almost every woman has witnessed—mansplaining—and, in the course of identifying that behavior, spurring a movement, online and offline, to share the ways in which patriarchal arrogance has intersected all our lives. (It would also come to be the titular essay in her collection published in 2014.) The Mother of All Questions follows up on that work and takes it further in order to examine the nature of self-expression—who is afforded it and denied it, what institutions have been put in place to limit it, and what happens when it is employed by women. Solnit has a singular gift for describing and decoding the misogynistic dynamics that govern the world so universally that they can seem invisible and the gendered violence that is so common as to seem unremarkable; this naming is powerful, and it opens space for sharing the stories that shape our lives.

The Mother of All Questions, comprised of essays written between 2014 and 2016, in many ways armed us with some of the tools necessary to survive the gaslighting of the Trump years, in which many of us—and especially women—have continued to hear from those in power that the things we see and hear do not exist and never existed. Solnit also acknowledges that labels like “woman,” and other gendered labels, are identities that are fluid in reality; in reviewing the book for The New Yorker, Moira Donegan suggested that, “One useful working definition of a woman might be ‘someone who experiences misogyny.'” Whichever words we use, Solnit writes in the introduction to the book that “when words break through unspeakability, what was tolerated by a society sometimes becomes intolerable.” This storytelling work has always been vital; it continues to be vital, and in this book, it is brilliantly done.  –Corinne Segal, Senior Editor"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"VALERIA LUISELLI, TELL ME HOW IT ENDS (2017)

The newly minted MacArthur fellow Valeria Luiselli’s four-part (but really six-part) essay Tell Me How It Ends: An Essay in Forty Questions was inspired by her time spent volunteering at the federal immigration court in New York City, working as an interpreter for undocumented, unaccompanied migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. Written concurrently with her novel Lost Children Archive (a fictional exploration of the same topic), Luiselli’s essay offers a fascinating conceit, the fashioning of an argument from the questions on the government intake form given to these children to process their arrivals. (Aside from the fact that this essay is a heartbreaking masterpiece, this is such a good conceit—transforming a cold, reproducible administrative document into highly personal literature.) Luiselli interweaves a grounded discussion of the questionnaire with a narrative of the road trip Luiselli takes with her husband and family, across America, while they (both Mexican citizens) wait for their own Green Card applications to be processed. It is on this trip when Luiselli reflects on the thousands of migrant children mysteriously traveling across the border by themselves. But the real point of the essay is to actually delve into the real stories of some of these children, which are agonizing, as well as to gravely, clearly expose what literally happens, procedural, when they do arrive—from forms to courts, as they’re swallowed by a bureaucratic vortex. Amid all of this, Luiselli also takes on more, exploring the larger contextual relationship between the United States of America and Mexico (as well as other countries in Central America, more broadly) as it has evolved to our current, adverse moment. Tell Me How It Ends is so small, but it is so passionate and vigorous: it desperately accomplishes in its less-than-100-pages-of-prose what centuries and miles and endless records of federal bureaucracy have never been able, and have never cared, to do: reverse the dehumanization of Latin American immigrants that occurs once they set foot in this country.  –Olivia Rutigliano, CrimeReads Editorial Fellow"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"ZADIE SMITH, FEEL FREE (2018)

In the essay “Meet Justin Bieber!” in Feel Free, Zadie Smith writes that her interest in Justin Bieber is not an interest in the interiority of the singer himself, but in “the idea of the love object”. This essay—in which Smith imagines a meeting between Bieber and the late philosopher Martin Buber (“Bieber and Buber are alternative spellings of the same German surname,” she explains in one of many winning footnotes. “Who am I to ignore these hints from the universe?”). Smith allows that this premise is a bit premise-y: “I know, I know.” Still, the resulting essay is a very funny, very smart, and un-tricky exploration of individuality and true “meeting,” with a dash of late capitalism thrown in for good measure. The melding of high and low culture is the bread and butter of pretty much every prestige publication on the internet these days (and certainly of the Twitter feeds of all “public intellectuals”), but the essays in Smith’s collection don’t feel familiar—perhaps because hers is, as we’ve long known, an uncommon skill. Though I believe Smith could probably write compellingly about anything, she chooses her subjects wisely. She writes with as much electricity about Brexit as the aforementioned Beliebers—and each essay is utterly engrossing. “She contains multitudes, but her point is we all do,” writes Hermione Hoby in her review of the collection in The New Republic. “At the same time, we are, in our endless difference, nobody but ourselves.”  –Jessie Gaynor, Social Media Editor"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"TRESSIE MCMILLAN COTTOM, THICK: AND OTHER ESSAYS (2019)

Tressie McMillan Cottom is an academic who has transcended the ivory tower to become the sort of public intellectual who can easily appear on radio or television talk shows to discuss race, gender, and capitalism. Her collection of essays reflects this duality, blending scholarly work with memoir to create a collection on the black female experience in postmodern America that’s “intersectional analysis with a side of pop culture.” The essays range from an analysis of sexual violence, to populist politics, to social media, but in centering her own experiences throughout, the collection becomes something unlike other pieces of criticism of contemporary culture. In explaining the title, she reflects on what an editor had said about her work: “I was too readable to be academic, too deep to be popular, too country black to be literary, and too naïve to show the rigor of my thinking in the complexity of my prose. I had wanted to create something meaningful that sounded not only like me, but like all of me. It was too thick.” One of the most powerful essays in the book is “Dying to be Competent” which begins with her unpacking the idiocy of LinkedIn (and the myth of meritocracy) and ends with a description of her miscarriage, the mishandling of black woman’s pain, and a condemnation of healthcare bureaucracy.

Tressie McMillan Cottom is an academic who has transcended the ivory tower to become the sort of public intellectual who can easily appear on radio or television talk shows to discuss race, gender, and capitalism. Her collection of essays reflects this duality, blending scholarly work with memoir to create a collection on the black female experience in postmodern America that’s “intersectional analysis with a side of pop culture.” The essays range from an analysis of sexual violence, to populist politics, to social media, but in centering her own experiences throughout, the collection becomes something unlike other pieces of criticism of contemporary culture.

,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"ROXANE GAY, BAD FEMINIST (2014)

Roxane Gay’s now-classic essay collection is a book that will make you laugh, think, cry, and then wonder, how can cultural criticism be this fun? My favorite essays in the book include Gay’s musings on competitive Scrabble, her stranded-in-academia dispatches, and her joyous film and television criticism, but given the breadth of topics Roxane Gay can discuss in an entertaining manner, there’s something for everyone in this one. This book is accessible because feminism itself should be accessible – Roxane Gay is as likely to draw inspiration from YA novels, or middle-brow shows about friendship, as she is to introduce concepts from the academic world, and if there’s anyone I trust to bridge the gap between high culture, low culture, and pop culture, it’s the Goddess of Twitter. I used to host a book club dedicated to radical reads, and this was one of the first picks for the club; a week after the book club met, I spied a few of the attendees meeting in the café of the bookstore, and found out that they had bonded so much over discussing Bad Feminist that they couldn’t wait for the next meeting of the book club to keep discussing politics and intersectionality, and that, in a nutshell, is the power of Roxane. –Molly Odintz, CrimeReads Associate Editor"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"RIVKA GALCHEN, LITTLE LABORS (2016)

Generally, I find stories about the trials and tribulations of child-having to be of limited appeal—useful, maybe, insofar as they offer validation that other people have also endured the bizarre realities of living with a tiny human, but otherwise liable to drift into the musings of parents thrilled at the simple fact of their own fecundity, as if they were the first ones to figure the process out (or not). But Little Labors is not simply an essay collection about motherhood, perhaps because Galchen initially “didn’t want to write about” her new baby—mostly, she writes, “because I had never been interested in babies, or mothers; in fact, those subjects had seemed perfectly not interesting to me.” Like many new mothers, though, Galchen soon discovered her baby—which she refers to sometimes as “the puma”—to be a preoccupying thought, demanding to be written about. Galchen’s interest isn’t just in her own progeny, but in babies in literature (“Literature has more dogs than babies, and also more abortions”), The Pillow Book, the eleventh-century collection of musings by Sei Shōnagon, and writers who are mothers. There are sections that made me laugh out loud, like when Galchen continually finds herself in an elevator with a neighbor who never fails to remark on the puma’s size. There are also deeper, darker musings, like the realization that the baby means “that it’s not permissible to die. There are days when this does not feel good.” It is a slim collection that I happened to read at the perfect time, and it remains one of my favorites of the decade. –Emily Firetog, Deputy Editor"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"CHARLIE FOX, THIS YOUNG MONSTER (2017)

On social media as in his writing, British art critic Charlie Fox rejects lucidity for allusion and doesn’t quite answer the Twitter textbox’s persistent question: “What’s happening?” These days, it’s hard to tell. This Young Monster (2017), Fox’s first book,was published a few months after Donald Trump’s election, and at one point Fox takes a swipe at a man he judges “direct from a nightmare and just a repulsive fucking goon.” Fox doesn’t linger on politics, though, since most of the monsters he looks at “embody otherness and make it into art, ripping any conventional idea of beauty to shreds and replacing it with something weird and troubling of their own invention.”

If clichés are loathed because they conform to what philosopher Georges Bataille called “the common measure,” then monsters are rebellious non-sequiturs, comedic or horrific derailments from a classical ideal. Perverts in the most literal sense, monsters have gone astray from some “proper” course. The book’s nine chapters, which are about a specific monster or type of monster, are full of callbacks to familiar and lesser-known media. Fox cites visual art, film, songs, and books with the screwy buoyancy of a savant. Take one of his essays, “Spook House,” framed as a stage play with two principal characters, Klaus (“an intoxicated young skinhead vampire”) and Hermione (“a teen sorceress with green skin and jet-black hair” who looks more like The Wicked Witch than her namesake). The chorus is a troupe of trick-or-treaters. Using the filmmaker Cameron Jamie as a starting point, the rest is free association on gothic decadence and Detroit and L.A. as cities of the dead. All the while, Klaus quotes from Artforum, Dazed & Confused, and Time Out.It’s a technical feat that makes fictionalized dialogue a conveyor belt for cultural criticism."
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"ELENA PASSARELLO, ANIMALS STRIKE CURIOUS POSES (2017)

Elena Passarello’s collection of essays Animals Strike Curious Poses picks out infamous animals and grants them the voice, narrative, and history they deserve. Not only is a collection like this relevant during the sixth extinction but it is an ambitious historical and anthropological undertaking, which Passarello has tackled with thorough research and a playful tone that rather than compromise her subject, complicates and humanizes it. Passarello’s intention is to investigate the role of animals across the span of human civilization and in doing so, to construct a timeline of humanity as told through people’s interactions with said animals. “Of all the images that make our world, animal images are particularly buried inside us,” Passarello writes in her first essay, to introduce us to the object of the book and also to the oldest of her chosen characters: Yuka, a 39,000-year-old mummified woolly mammoth discovered in the Siberian permafrost in 2010. It was an occasion so remarkable and so unfathomable given the span of human civilization that Passarello says of Yuka: “Since language is epically younger than both thought and experience, ‘woolly mammoth’ means, to a human brain, something more like time.” The essay ends with a character placing a hand on a cave drawing of a woolly mammoth, accompanied by a phrase which encapsulates the author’s vision for the book: “And he becomes the mammoth so he can envision the mammoth.” In Passarello’s hands the imagined boundaries between the animal, natural, and human world disintegrate and what emerges is a cohesive if baffling integrated history of life. With the accuracy and tenacity of a journalist and the spirit of a storyteller, Elena Passarello has assembled a modern bestiary worthy of contemplation and awe. –Eleni Theodoropoulos, Editorial Fellow"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"ESMÉ WEIJUN WANG, THE COLLECTED SCHIZOPHRENIAS (2019)

Esmé Weijun Wang’s collection of essays is a kaleidoscopic look at mental health and the lives affected by the schizophrenias. Each essay takes on a different aspect of the topic, but you’ll want to read them together for a holistic perspective. Esmé Weijun Wang generously begins The Collected Schizophrenias by acknowledging the stereotype, “Schizophrenia terrifies. It is the archetypal disorder of lunacy.” From there, she walks us through the technical language, breaks down the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5)’s clinical definition. And then she gets very personal, telling us about how she came to her own diagnosis and the way it’s touched her daily life (her relationships, her ideas about motherhood). Esmé Weijun Wang is uniquely situated to write about this topic. As a former lab researcher at Stanford, she turns a precise, analytical eye to her experience while simultaneously unfolding everything with great patience for her reader. Throughout, she brilliantly dissects the language around mental health. (On saying “a person living with bipolar disorder” instead of using “bipolar” as the sole subject: “…we are not our diseases. We are instead individuals with disorders and malfunctions. Our conditions lie over us like smallpox blankets; we are one thing and the illness is another.”) She pinpoints the ways she arms herself against anticipated reactions to the schizophrenias: high fashion, having attended an Ivy League institution. In a particularly piercing essay, she traces mental illness back through her family tree. She also places her story within more mainstream cultural contexts, calling on groundbreaking exposés about the dangerous of institutionalization and depictions of mental illness in television and film (like the infamous Slender Man case, in which two young girls stab their best friend because an invented Internet figure told them to). At once intimate and far-reaching, The Collected Schizophrenias is an informative and important (and let’s not forget artful) work. I’ve never read a collection quite so beautifully-written and laid-bare as this. –Katie Yee, Book Marks Assistant Editor"
,,,,,books and literature,,,,,,,,,"ROSS GAY, THE BOOK OF DELIGHTS (2019)

When Ross Gay began writing what would become The Book of Delights, he envisioned it as a project of daily essays, each focused on a moment or point of delight in his day. This plan quickly disintegrated; on day four, he skipped his self-imposed assignment and decided to “in honor and love, delight in blowing it off.” (Clearly, “blowing it off” is a relative term here, as he still produced the book.) Ross Gay is a generous teacher of how to live, and this moment of reveling in self-compassion is one lesson among many in The Book of Delights, which wanders from moments of connection with strangers to a shade of “red I don’t think I actually have words for,” a text from a friend reading “I love you breadfruit,” and “the sun like a guiding hand on my back, saying everything is possible. Everything.”


Gay does not linger on any one subject for long, creating the sense that delight is a product not of extenuating circumstances, but of our attention; his attunement to the possibilities of a single day, and awareness of all the small moments that produce delight, are a model for life amid the warring factions of the attention economy. These small moments range from the physical–hugging a stranger, transplanting fig cuttings–to the spiritual and philosophical, giving the impression of sitting beside Gay in his garden as he thinks out loud in real time. It’s a privilege to listen. –Corinne Segal, Senior Editor"

It makes man the smartest creature on earth. It empowers humans and gets them ready to face challenges of life efficiently.

They are taught the sense of wrong and write, consideration for others, fair play and honesty that matters in citizenship, upholding the laws, co-operation, etc. Hence, education makes them a good citizen.

(iii) Transmits the Central Heritage: Every society is balance by the involvement of its culture that carries music, religion, philosophy, art, literature, beliefs and skills. Cultures are mainly dispatches by social foundations and education has a leading role in radiating the cultures or social heritage. A cultured person is the outcome of a robust education system.

(iv) Social Bonding: Educated society has a strong bonding between its individuals. Because, people from all region, cast and backgrounds gather to collect knowledge. Thus, education is the primary thing that brings its youth together and forms a unique bonding between them. Educated society people are open-minded and do not prefer to judge others.

(v) Help Communities: People collect knowledge, not for themselves but to help out other communities and society. Professionals such as doctors, engineers, etc. give facilities to others."
,,,,,education,,,,,,,,,"A sound educational system works for the good of the country. A country mainly is judge by its economy and education system. A nation is growing day by day just because of its technology and education.

(i) Choose Good Leader: Educated people understand the difference between a good and an evil leader for their country to lead. Educated people know why to vote for a party to bring a positive resolution to the development of the country.

(ii) Prevent Poverty: Due to the lack of education, people are often unemployed that shows the low level of economic status of a nation. Pathetic plight of a country obstructs its progress and development. Thus, education is must to boost economic growth and increase income.

(iii) Health Standard: Education also promotes the health status of a country. A quality education gives many pharmacists and doctors to a nation. Therefore, the citizens of a nation live healthy and happy.

(iv) Provides Services: A country can be serviceable on behalf of education. The blend of ideas and techniques given by educated people brings invention and industrial development. And also, educated people can work with them. As a result, the country is known as more powerful and achieve significant fame in advancement."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"There are many celebrations in countries in the world. Some of them are funny and interesting, some are traditional or religious. No matter what they are, celebrations play an importantrole  in our lives. Without celebrations, we can’t enjoy this life fully.

       Celebrations make life more enjoyable and fun. For instance, in Vietnam we celebrate the Mid-autumn Festival on the 14th day of the 8th lunar month annually. In this time, children wear masks, have parties with special cakes and lots of fruits,...This celebration makes them very excited to wait for it. Or on Women Day, which falls on March 8th, people celebrate the equality between men and women. Family members and friends give flowers and gifts to women, who feel very happy about it. More and more celebrations that interest people all over the world such as Beer Festival, Tomato Festival, Halloween celebration
Especially in Father’s Day or Mother’s Day, you can give your parents gifts, flowers or greeting cards to express how you love them. In Teacher Day, Students show their love and respect to the teachers. Students give flowers and best wishes to their teachers.

       Celebrations also remind people of important days, or great time in the year. For example, every country has its own Independence Day, which is almost the greatest day in a year. This is the time for people to recall and be proud of their history. Another important celebration is New year’s day when people all over the world celebrate the first day of the new year. This day remind them that one year has passed and the new one is coming with brand-new things.

   Being held through the year, celebrations are part of our

,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Festivals are part of one’s custom, culture and tradition. They are there for us to celebrate. It helps us forget our routine. It gives us some momentary, mental and physical relaxation and thus frees us from die shackles of monotonous work.

In India alone there are over 100 festivals celebrated throughout a year. The reason is that there are all religions like, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhism, Jainism, Parsis and so on.

Indian festivals are chiefly season-oriented; summer, winter, spring and autumn. Besides, there is much other regional festival like South, North, East, West, etc. Every festival tells a message pertaining to our customs, traditional values, mythology, culture, even historical events and the birth of the New Year too."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Diwali, festival of lights is the major festival in India for the Hindus. However, there are many others like Lord Ganesh Chaturthi, Dusshera, Vijayadasami, Holi, Janmashtami, Sri Ram Navami, Onam and all. But more than anything else, it is worth mentioning that not a single Hindu festival is celebrated without providing a livelihood for the poor.

Camphor, betel leaves and nuts, crackers, lowers and garlands, coconuts, bananas, plantain leaves, turmeric, honey and many such commodities, with which every festival is celebrated, help the poor farmers and the laborers to earn money for their bread. Even clay soil also fetches money to the poor as they make out Lord Ganesh idols with that.

For Muslims, Ramzan is the most important festival. This is the beginning of the new month according to Arabic calendar. Muslims, who follow the strict custom of fasting for the whole month, break their fasting on being announced in the Mosque after the sighting of the Moon. Their devotion is praise-worthy."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Moreover, they help in setting aside the differences of the countrymen and unite each other like never before. The capital of India, New Delhi is the seat of national festivals. For instance, it witnesses the grand parade of the Republic Day. The flag hoisting takes place in New Delhi, which is broadcasted on national television for the whole country to see.

Religious Festivals

The religious festivals are one of the most famous festivals not only throughout India but over the world. Some of the most prominent religious festivals are Diwali, Eid-Ul-Fitr, Christmas, Guru Nanak Jayanti, Holi and many more. Diwali and Holi are the most prominent festivals of the Hindu religion. They are very colorful and full of lights.

Next up an Islamic festival which celebrates the end of Ramadan. It is about delectable dishes and family gatherings. Christmas celebrates the birthday of Jesus Christ. Furthermore, it is about Christmas trees and Santa Claus. Guru Nanak Jayanti celebrates the birthday of Guru Nanak Dev."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Finally, the particular regions of the country celebrate seasonal festivals. For instance, Bihu is a festival of Assam. Likewise, Tamil Nadu celebrates Pongal. In addition, there is Basant Panchami which people celebrate through North India and West Bengal as well.

Importance of Festivals

Festivals are very important. They make us forget our cultural and religious differences. They unite people and they come together for the sole purpose of celebration and happiness. Other than that, festivals also help us embrace our culture and religion. They are very helpful in breaking the monotony of life.

Moreover, people look forward to festivals all-round the year. Festivals spark joy and give people something to look forward to. In addition, people also repair their homes and paint them that look like brand new. It beautifies the look of the locality.

In short, festivals fill our lives with colors and enthusiasm. They bring us closer every year and eliminate any feelings of communal hatred. Further, they strengthen the bonds of the community and remove the malice from people’s hearts. Therefore, festivals are quite important and must be celebrated with passion."
,,,,,holidays,,,,,,,,,"Christmas Eve tops all festivals celebrated by Christian’s world over. It is the birth of Jesus Christ.

They assemble at the church for the mid-night mass and greet their friends and relatives.

Similarly, there are other festivals too. Temple festivals, Food festivals, Folk festivals, Fairs and many others. However, if there is an eve that unites one irrespective of one’s race, religion, caste creed, origin and all other differences and promotes total integration throughout the world, it is the English New Year!

New Year is the true secular festival. People, in spite of their differences, greet each other during New Year forgetting their own straits."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Leisure activities are a virtual necessity. They are needed to keep people from degenerating into one-dimensional personalities. Sticking with one thing over and over again, would not bring the kind of fresh insights to the work which one can get from other activities. Outside activities have a nice regenerative effect and pump people with energy. Often, output exceeds the input. These activities provide new challenges.

When people find themselves successfully meeting those challenges in after- work pursuits, it generates a kind of confidence in them, which would be helpful in boosting their regular work or career.

Another spillover effect from non-vocational activities or hobbies is that the creative juices generated by them continue to flow much afterwards. There are several other benefits as well. Sometimes the thought of indulging in a leisure activity would help people pull through a particularly rough workday. Then the amount of sheer relaxation that can be derived from a game, a rehearsal or a pleasant drive is no less. Even a nightly crossword puzzle or watching a TV programme can be a powerful stress-buster. However, the problem is that even these activities can become dreadfully routine and uninspiring."
,,,,,"hobbies and pasttimes
leisure activities",,,,,,,,,"Hobbies help people to feel that they are interesting and even help in advancing their outer image. Participation in outside activities makes a person more interesting as other people start perceiving that way. In fact, one can get the image one wants simply by taking up the right sport. So, it is no wonder that extra-curricular activities and hobbies are given consideration during interviews. A challenging activity makes the candidate far more attractive, and probably a better performer.

Given the huge amount of benefits to be derived from leisure activities, it is no surprise that some people go a little overboard. As a result, people slowly find themselves disliking so many of the things they do that their life becomes full of tension. Frustrating leisure activities is a sure sign that something is wrong. Hence, it is important to figure out what you are getting from each activity. It would be useful to do some analysis and weed out the less beneficial of the various activities performed. A pastime may be relaxing you, challenging you, or making a contribution to your community.

Figure out what exactly you want from your pastime and accordingly modify your activities. If possible, select your hobbies that are different from your everyday work. For example, if your work involves spending time with over-grown people, find something where you can interact with children.

Some people mistake a necessary sporting activity as a leisure activity. For example, in the business world, playing golf is a must activity for developing network. People take it up for official reasons and hence it cannot be considered a leisure activity because there you are interacting for business reasons. Hence, it has to be considered a part of your business activity, unless you also happen to enjoy it."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Today life is full of stress and anxiety and especially in metropolitan cities situation is the worst. Everyone is busy with his life, no time for family and himself even. Every person is running behind his hectic schedule. Life become so fast but still no time to relax for 5 minute and release the stress. No need to explain, you can easily analyze when you are in hurry to reach the office thinking of some of your personal tensions and then the whole day hectic schedule. 
Entertainment can add salt in this discomfort and distasteful life. It is the way of entertainment which keeps the life going. Else life becomes very dull and boring. Entertainment gives the life its charm and energy. 
Entertainment can be of any type depending on one's choice and likes. A tired person after coming back from office, if got a 15 minute time to watch its favorite show then that time is enough to relax his tiring mind. This small time period of entertainment can give a smile and a soothing effect to his mind.
Music is a great way to relive the day to day stress. Almost every person is interested in any kind of music. People of the older times love classical music whereas kids like rhymes and children music. Not only this, many are attracted to listen natural sounds such as chirping of birds, water falling from the mountains and religious chants.
When a person sits down with his eyes closed to listen his favorite music, the heart beat goes balanced and mind got relaxed. Music tunes the soul and renews the body.
Playing music also relaxes the mind and slows down the tension. Interested people find pleasure in playing his favorite instrument. A piano or a guitar strings can give pleasure to a stressed mind.
Other than music, reading is one of the good sources of entertainment. People who love reading can go for good source of stuff to read. It can help relieve stress and definitely reenergize the mind. Reading is a very good habit. It not only helps to gain knowledge but creates good vocabulary and helps to have a better look of the outside world.
Going out for picnic, chatting with family members or friends, dancing, singing etc. can give pleasure to a tired and sick mind. These simple ways lift up the mood and can buzz the day and put the life at an ease.
In short, any sort of entertainment should be there in life to remove the boredom of life and to make the life dynamic and exciting always."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"I am fairly certain we have all been affected by some form of entertainment at one point in our lives, whether it's the disturbing truth from a report on the news, or a show we watched everyday in our childhood. But truly, we can all look at our lives and find that it has somehow been influenced by entertainment in some form.

Photographs in magazines, depicting a number of things, from severely thin super models to starving children in 3rd world countries, are an example. I see these seemingly perfect people, displaying an ideal, something that society supposedly wants people to be like, and then I see a starving child. Personally, that puts life into perspective for me. What is more important, the beautiful, flawless shoes the super model advertises, or feeding that child?

Music is another influential thing that we hear everyday-holiday music, for example, is a weird little thing in our lives. Some of us simply can't wait for the holidays, to hear cheery carols and feel the holiday spirit. Others just want the holidays to go away, for several reasons, from not having anyone to share the joy with, or just to get some peace from all the relatives and holiday marketing hype around them.

Ultimately entertainment is aimed at affecting us, whether it be a in a good way or a bad way. Fashion magazines are aimed at getting people to follow certain trends and styles, and ultimately buying products that they advertise. News reports are a matter of opinion-you may think they are simply reporting facts, or simply throwing propaganda at you, or trying to get ratings. These days you'll notice that many companies, bands, governments, etc. are taking advantage of the internet to get messages into the world. With entertainment websites like You Tube, they hope to convey their objectives through entertainment, because it's what people pay attention to now.

Entertainment does and continues to affect us, whether we want it to or not."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Yes, entertainment has a tremendous affect on society, as it amuses us, making us increasingly more inclined toward our most basic instincts, perverting us, though the enternees are mostly at fault.
I believe that the entertainers are at fault, but those who encourage and pay the entertainers, us Americans, are really to blame.
Back in the old days, the gladiators who fought each other and animals with the utmost brutality were not at fault, but those who cheered them on and forced them to make a living or the ending thereof doing what they are known for, entertainment, grotesque or just downright perverted, such as the comedy shows of today, with their perverse innuendos, gestures, and jokes.
Ultimately, the entertainers are not innocent, but they are pawns who are payed to do what they do, and that is to amuse us (cause us to think less and less with each and every performance), as they would have found or sought other professions had they not had the ability to do what they do for what they are being payed.
Therefore, they are generally pleased with their lifestyle, though most of them are unable to do anything else for money, other than the occasional surprising performance or some random or purposeful violaton of the law, which increases their popularity as well as their chances of boosting their ticket sales or any other business venture that they think that they can successfully pull off a profit with."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Entertainment- whether via music, television, books, or cinema- has the uncanny ability to destroy society. It can invade and infect the minds of impressionable youth, encouraging drug-use, violence, and premarital sex. It can steal from perfectly good, god-fearing people many hours of each day that would otherwise have been put to better use. As a whole, entertainment is a plague upon society.
Many movies subtly and insidiously encourage drug use among youth. The so-called work of cinema Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle serves as little more than a 2 hour advertisement for drug dealers. It propagates the view that drug use is “cool” and “acceptable” and even goes so far as to depict one of the main characters, Harold (a regular marijuana-smoker) as a good, hard-working citizen. Such flagrant abuse of reality should not be sustained in a civilized society; everyone knows that even an occasional user of Marijuana can contribute nothing to the world. It is a travesty that countless children and teenagers are allowed to be corrupted by Cinema.
Music is no less vicious a demon. Popular bands such as Hawthorne Heights and Silverstein encourage self-harm and suicide. In a popular Hawthorne Heights song “Ohio is for lovers” the singer heart-wrenchingly wails “So cut my wrists and black my eyes, so I can fall asleep tonight, or die.” Youth across the world embrace this song as the anthem of their lives. Instead of finding realistic solutions to emotional problems they encounter, many misguided young adults follow the advice of their idols. Undoubtedly instances of wrist-cutting and eye-blacking increased throughout the world as a result of Hawthorne Heights. 
Books are perhaps the greatest evil of all. Unspoken symbols, so-called “letters’ and “words” place their meanings inside your brain if you so much as look at them for too long. Among youth, once again, the problem is the worst; new vocabulary words, such as the derisive “******” can be obtained from books. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, features the word ****** 215 times total, according to Wikipedia. A poor, unknowing child who stumbles upon this work of Satan will undoubtedly begin using the word ****** to describe their peers, parents and teachers. The bible is the only literary work which anyone under the age of 18 should be allowed to read. Anything else will directly and efficiently subvert the child, lead him away from god, and devour his soul.
Clearly, entertainment is the greatest evil of modern society. It should be quickly and entirely abolished. Then, perhaps, civilization will be able to grow and evolve until we achieve the theocracy the pilgrims dreamed of when they first set foot on the shores of our beautiful nation. Until then we will have a nation of drug using, wrist-cutting, racist children who will one day be our leaders. Undoubtedly, an America in such dire straits would not survive. With lots of work and prayer, the effects of entertainment on society may one day be reversed."

Three days he stayed there, singing and praying. He was alone with nature and nature’s spirit. His tribe traditionally used smoke signals to transmit messages over long distances. He had learned much from his time with the spirit and wanted to share it with his friends and family back home, however he was not ready to leave. He was not yet satisfied that he had a complete understanding of the truth. Socahtoa gathered his wood and smoke stacks.

Sesame Street sought to use the medium of television for good by educating children using cartoons. Sesame Street helped children develop a love for learning; however, it also conditioned kids to only love school if it is like Sesame Street (143). This is a problem because the medium of TV does not allow students to ask questions, requires no social behavior, and teaches kids more about images than about language. Children expect to be constantly entertained, and thus do not want to patiently wait to learn how to read and write or go through the long process of philosophical discussion. When watching Sesame Street, children are allowed to sit on a couch in their pajamas eating popcorn while they learn, so they expect the same at school. The kids do not have to read or do any other type of meaningful work to absorb the images from the television screen, so Postman Says they don’t want to work hard to learn in school. The problem with Sesame Street is not that the publishers did a poor job, but that the medium of television cannot accomplish the goal of teaching children to use language, behave properly, and ask questions. Postman suggests that the medium of TV is not well suited for teaching"
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.
The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.
An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.
Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.
The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.
Entertainment can be distinguished from other activities such as education and marketing even though they have learned how to use the appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals. Sometimes entertainment can be a mixture for both. The importance and impact of entertainment is recognised by scholars and its increasing sophistication has influenced practices in other fields such as museology.
Psychologists say the function of media entertainment is ""the attainment of gratification"". No other results or measurable benefit are usually expected from it (except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment). This is in contrast to education (which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more ""entertaining"" and entertainment or marketing seek to be more ""educational"". Such mixtures are often known by the neologisms ""edutainment"" or ""infotainment"". The psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields. Some education-entertainment is a serious attempt to combine the best features of the two. Some people are entertained by others' pain or the idea of their unhappiness (schadenfreude)."

Our choices of entertainment determine who we are to an extent. It is more of how we act on the influences we see in entertainment. We all love juicy drama and scandals because it adds suspense in our lives. We like seeing who wore it best when you open up a magazine just because it gives us something to do on our spare time. What makes us mold our behavior and thinking when it comes to entertainment is how you stay true to yourself and not let the tabloids and television shows change the person you originally were. Mass entertainment has determined the type of people who are in our society in a negative light by the reality television shows and social media being involved in our everyday lives. The common way we get away from our sometimes boring or stressful lives is by seeing what is going on in mass media such as your favorite reality television show.

,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that improve the mind, such as reading and doing word puzzles. Other people feel that it is important to rest the mind during leisure time. 

Discuss both views and give your opinion.

Leisure time is necessary for people after working and studying hard, and there are various recreation activities to do base on oneself purpose. Many people support the methods helping the mind getting better, while others endorse the thinking to rest in free time, but it is more effective if we take part in outside activities.

It is true that people can improve their personal ability by practicing pursuits improving the mind. By doing the word puzzles, this activity helps us raise the logical thinking and solve problems at work more effectively. On the other hand, we can wider our knowledge and absorb more information from many kind of books, the mental health will be better.

Standing at the other view, putting the mind at rest by enjoying media entertainment, people reduce the stress. After long day at work or school, we usually feel tired and need to relax. There are many channels such as watching films, listening music and playing games, our mind will balance again.

However, the pursuits of two sorts above have some disadvantages, such as we feel more stressful when practicing the mind or to be not conscious if using electronic entertaining methods, we should take outdoor actions. When enjoying outside events, for instance, doing exercise or playing sports bring about our physical health will be better, the mind will be refreshed and having energies for new works. 

In summary, doing activities, improving our mind in leisure time will enhance our thinking but perhaps, also lead to feeling more stressful. Meanwhile, laying the mind to rest helping us reduce work’s pressure, however, we can feel graver. Personally, participating in outside pursuits is good for both metal and physical health."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Leisure time is a use of free time for enjoyment. We may define leisure as freedom from the demands of work or duty. Everybody needs leisure in their lives, to balance the stress of work and life. Leisure helps re-energize and relax people, so they can perform activities well in their lives. Different age of people use their free or leisure time in a variety of different ways. Kids engaging in outdoor activities, entertainment like watching movies or television, playing video or mobile games etc or Adult people have hobbies like gardening, or socializing with family and friends or just having time to themselves. In short we can say when one can rest, enjoy hobbies or sports, etc.

Nobody can keep on working continuously without leisure. It is an essential part of our lives,  In our society we have a hard time and unable to find time to relax.  Continuously remain busy in work not only exhaust our body but our mind also get tired. So the free time is the time spent away from business, work, job hunting, domestic chores, and education, as well as necessary activities such as eating and sleeping.

Leisure time Lowers Stress and Depression. Mental wellness is an important part of our overall health and can impact our physical well-being. Participating in leisure and recreation activities can help us better manage stress and reduce depression."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Human beings on the whole are more apt to be idle when they should  work, than to work when they require rest . Therefore, hobbies build confidence because being good at something and learning something new is very rewarding.  Hobbies that require some level of physical activity also create chemical changes in our body that help reduce stress but even if our hobby does not require physical activity we can still benefit. While too much free time can become problematic.Now let us see how we should employ our leisure time . There are many people who think that leisure means plain idleness. Leisure time does not mean that we adopt such activities which are not according to our age or we start wasting our much time. Like some people are in the habit of putting off their work for tomorrow. One great danger of this bad habit lies in the uncertainty of the future . By tomorrow circumstance may have undergone a change, and it may be then out of our power to do what we intended. Thus it is a wrong idea about leisure or rest . Rest or recreation really means a change from one kind of activity to another more common .

So passing the time are perfectly harmless if used in moderation as means of refreshing our weary faculties. Leisure time is necessary for us and no doubt we should have it."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Many feel that it is important to plan out their free time activities, while others opt to live more spontaneously. In my opinion, planning can be useful but over time it will devalue the activities themselves.
Arranging one’s leisure activities ahead of time is a natural impulse to ease tension and ensure their usefulness. Some psychologists have termed humans the ‘planning animal’ because of an inborn tendency arising from a calming need for security. To the person doing the planning, this serves the secondary purpose of ensuring they are not wasting their time. For example, if a motivated individual plans their day they might set out to do some exercise, read a book, finish some work at home, and cook a meal. These are productive tasks that will lead to a feeling of fulfillment at the end of the day.
However, this drive causes undue pressure and hinders enjoyment of a given activity. The human propensity to plan is also an underlying cause of stress and keeps individuals from being fully present in the moment. This can result in a situation where pre-planned activities become joyless. For instance, the person described above who maps out their day might feel they are simply ticking items off a to-do list and not enjoy the activity in itself. Contrast this with a more spontaneous lifestyle that still entails productivity but does not set a purposeful goal for every action. This person will accomplish just as much but enjoy it much more since they can be fully invested in the moment and act.
In conclusion, the useful aspects of planning do not outweigh the worth derived from spontaneous action. Individuals must naturally strike a balance but be mindful they are not subordinating an activity to its utilitarian value."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"In such an activity you may end up feeling more tensed rather than relaxed. There is definitely no harm with developing interests that will put you in touch with the right people, but do not try to convince yourself that you are having fun, while the truth is otherwise.

Many a times, people take a vacation only to find themselves wanting to relax more than the day they left for vacation. This occurs because people often put off their much needed vacation and takes it up only when they are full of depression and fatigue. By the time they pack their bags, they find that they cannot leave their troubles at home and they cannot enjoy being anywhere else. To avoid such a situation, it would be advisable to take major vacations at regular intervals with a few long weekends in between.

Our society is terribly undereducated concerning leisure options. The security of tradition combines with an innate fear of unknown to keep people from finding a new vacation place or activity which they might truly enjoy. People often keep on visiting the same place again and again for vacation, even though the place which was once enjoyable no longer rests and regenerates them.

If that is the case it would be advisable to experiment with different kinds of vacation options. Or at the very least, add a couple of new activities to your things-to-do list for your vacation. Do not add more new activities lest you end up with too many things to do with too little time to do it. The most important thing to remember when you come back from a vacation is to give yourself a one-day buffer going back to your usual routine. Otherwise, it can result in a low feeling for first couple of days on routine work and may result in some disorientation and confusion. One needs to remember that it is not easy to shift gears instantly because your mind and body may still be in vacation mode."

This sometime, of his own is the leisure time. It is the time when one is free to do what he chooses. Where time is unobligated and one is free to do what he pleases, how he pleases and with whom he pleases, it is known as leisure.

Unlike rest leisure also conserves the vital energies and affords the body and the train their most important and vital opportunity for regeneration, Leisure may be thought about by recreation, change of work, sitting comfortably or by sleeping.
It safeguards against over work and helpful for mental assimilation. After continuous hours of monotonous activities leisure provides mental relaxation. Leisure acts as ‘tension releaser’. Irrespective of young and old, everybody needs leisure after a long period of continuous work both physical and mental.

Leisure also plays vital role in the field of education At present not only traditional subjects find place in the curriculum but also there is direction for the leisure which is growing importance. Training for the wise use of leisure is one of the cardinal objectives of education.

So education for the wise and constructive use of leisure should start early in the home and the school and continue throughout the life span. The curriculum should be designed to train the students not only for work but also for leisure.

For using leisure hour effectively variety of activities such as social, aesthetic, sports etc. should be introduced in the school. These activities are recommended not only to make school life pleasant and meaningful for the students but also to cultivate varied interests and hobbies which provide excellent training for leisure."
,,,,,education,,,,,,,,,"The Secondary Education Commission has recommended the following basic principles of curriculum construction:

1. Principle of Totality of Experience.

According to the Secondary Education Commission, “The curriculum does not include only the academic subjects traditionally taught in the school but it includes the totality of experiences that a pupil receives through manifold activities that go in the school, in the class-room, library, laboratory, workshop, play-ground, and in numerous informal contacts between teachers and pupils.” All types of experiences in the school or planned by the school should be included in the school curriculum.

2. Principle of Variety and Elasticity.

The curriculum should be broad-based and include activities and subjects according to the different types of pupils. It should be adaptable to their individual needs and interests.

3. Principle of Relating to Community Life.

The curriculum must be related to life around the child. There should be community oriented programmes in the school so that the child feels himself as an integral part of the local community. The curriculum should bring school and community closer. Due importance should be given to the productive work which is a vital part of organised human life.

4. Principle of Training or Leisure.

The curriculum should be framed to train pupils, not only for work but also for leisure. There should be a number of activities-social, aesthetic, sports etc. which should cultivate varied interests and hobbies in the students. These will train them to use their leisure time properly.

5. Principle of Integration and Correlation.

The activities and subjects of the curriculum should be well correlated and integrated. These should not be put into water- tight compartments. The curriculum should present ‘broad-field’ units which have direct bearing on life."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Leisure means free time. Leisure is a time when one is not busy in the routine work. If leisure is spent in some pleasant pursuit, it gives a great joy. Leisure gives back I the lost energy to the mind. One can spend one’s leisure in gardening, painting, photography, reading, rowing, stamp collecting etc. Today, man is not happy with what he has. He wants to earn more and more money. So he has no leisure. He lives in stress and strain. He suffers from many diseases such as sleeplessness, hypertension and nervous breakdown. Therefore, there is need to have leisure. One should not idle away one’s leisure. Leisure has great significance in a man’s life. It is only the right pursuit during leisure which can give us real happiness."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Leisure is that sweetest of moments when a man has nothing specific to do, when he is his own master and can dispose of his spare time at his own sweet will. Not only is a man then free from work, he is with an unoccupied mind.

The necessity for having a rest from work and worry cannot be too much stressed. It has been said—sweet is pleasure after pain, i.e. labour. Nothing wears out a man both physically and mentally as continuous pre-occupation with worldly matters.

Most men, therefore, find life a strenuous business. This is the tragedy of life; work and work —both are equally unavoidable yet both are equally tiresome. The continuity of this chain has to be broken now and then to enable one to recover one’s freshness, to take mind off, on a holiday. Leisure breaks upon the monotony of existence with a touch of variety. Man’s life is usually bound by routine; leisure affords an opportunity to escape out of the compulsions of routine and breathe the fresh air of freedom. This, therefore, is always a source of joy whenever it comes.
But the problem is—how to acquire leisure. Life is not an easy affair these days. The mere task of keeping the body and soul together strains resources to the utmost limit. To live well one has to be incessantly toiling, just to earn that extra bit of money. We all are slaves to necessities.

Hence, the problem of having a work-free period is difficult to solve. The best way to do it is to have a socialistic society, where work is rationed in terms of social needs. But that society still remains an ideal. The old-school people say — if your work does not give you anything more than mere subsistence, be contented with that, and instead of multiplying hours of work to win a surplus income — to bring grist to the mill-take and hour or two off to wander away into the dreamland of your fancy or thoughts of God or religion.

But suppose we have snatched a period of leisure from the tyranny of routine, very few of us know how to spend our work-free hours. It is necessary for all of us to cultivate some hobby, something non-essential in which our minds may have rest and relaxation.

Human brain reaches a fatigue curve by constantly minding remunerative work. Brain and brawn then need respite or leisure. But the idle brain is the devil’s workshop. So some hobby should be cultivated and pursued to recuperate our energy. Book-lovers can turn over the pages of some favourite book. Those who love the open-air country-side may take to the joy of standing out in the open and feed their senses with the sights and sounds that create beauty and music. Of course, there is no limit to ways in which we can get through time fruitfully.
Leisure perhaps is the very essence of life. We live not to create work but to enjoy leisure. Somerset Maugm considers leisure as the most priceless thing a man can have. To him the only object of work is to obtain leisure.

So Bertrand Russell prescribed only four hour work a day to earn livelihood and the rest is for enjoying leisure. Or we may say, the sole purpose of work is to create leisure. The happiest man, of course, is he whose work is leisure, who finds perpetual joy in the work he has to perform, i.e. who earns his living by his hobby. For, to such a man work is never a soul-killing drudgery. So the Government of a welfare state of today has a Ministry of Leisure to suggest ways to fruitfully spend spare time."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Leisure means rest from one’s main’s work. It means occupation of the mind and the body in a kind of work other than one’s main occupation of life. A gardener may be busy in photography after his day’s work in the garden is over and a photographer may be busy digging the earth, weeding and hoeing and watering the plants in his small vegetable garden, in a corner of the compound of his house after his day’s busy programme at his studio.

Modern life is very complex. It is full of worry and hurry. Everybody is too busy to stand and stare. The wear and tear of the mind and the body go on. Everybody is so absorbed in affairs that he has no time to relax and get away from his work and worries. Everybody is over worked. The result is that the majority of people suffer from physics and mental disorders which hasten one’s end.

Leisure does not mean that we should just sit and smoke away our time or wander about aimlessly. Leisure does not mean idleness It is not to be spent in a round of noisy amusement or in a restless rush of exciting pleasures. It is not to be spent in playing cards gambling, drunkeness and idle gossips. It is an abuse of leisure.
Leisure should restore our energies and so make us fit for work again. A change of occupation is also rest. Reading good book like biographies of great men in our leisure hours is very good. Teaching the illiterate in our leisure hours is the greatest good that we can do to our illiterate brethren. A good action is its own reward.

If we waste time, time shall waste us. In our leisure hours, we can take a long walk. We can go for hiking. We can have a picnic. We can go to a club. We can go to a public library. We can practice swimming.

We learn a bit of carpentry so that we may make small articles for our household use. We may practice painting and photography. We can collect stamps, nests, flowers, match-box labels and photos of smiling faces or we can collect old coins. They are all very educative. Our album of smiling faces shall make us happy and cheerful when we feel sad and melancholy. We can learn music. It gives the best diversion.

In brief, leisure is a necessity in the interest of health and efficiency. It prolongs our life and makes it worth living. We don’t feel bored."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Leisure activities are a virtual necessity. They are needed to keep people from degenerating into one-dimensional personalities. Sticking with one thing over and over again, would not bring the kind of fresh insights to the work which one can get from other activities. Outside activities have a nice regenerative effect and pump people with energy. Often, output exceeds the input. These activities provide new challenges.

When people find themselves successfully meeting those challenges in after- work pursuits, it generates a kind of confidence in them, which would be helpful in boosting their regular work or career.

Another spillover effect from non-vocational activities or hobbies is that the creative juices generated by them continue to flow much afterwards. There are several other benefits as well. Sometimes the thought of indulging in a leisure activity would help people pull through a particularly rough workday. Then the amount of sheer relaxation that can be derived from a game, a rehearsal or a pleasant drive is no less. Even a nightly crossword puzzle or watching a TV programme can be a powerful stress-buster. However, the problem is that even these activities can become dreadfully routine and uninspiring."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"When we are much too busy with our daily chores, either in office, factory or at home, to read the books we like or indulge in other constructive and gainful activity, or attend to the duties remaining after the previous day’s or week’s busy schedule, we show a lack of the true sense of citizenship and unawareness of how leisure should be utilized.

Obviously, leisure should be treated as opportunity for fruitful activity and creativeness. It is through creativity, the feeling that we have achieved something in a healthy sphere of human activity that we can promote our and our family’s well being.

Time is undoubtedly the most precious thing on earth; it can never be called back; one hour or a day wasted is gone forever, never to return. The hours and the minutes tickle past us constantly, and it is said that time and tied wait for no one. This realization should make us all fully conscious of the value of time and of leisure, for leisure is, after all, time that we spend according to our choice. And our culture and capacity, our education and our sense of good citizenship are all reflected in the use we make of leisure.

There are people who are so material minded, and so anxious to earn and save money, that they believe leisure should be utilized for supplementing one’s earnings so as to make up for the deficit in the family budget caused by inadequate incomes and ever-mounting expenditure and prices. But that would mean taking a narrow and worldly view of leisure.
"
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Repetitive tasks certainly lead to boredom, and the frantic continuation of the money-earning process, by working overtime or taking up some other boring work during the leisure hours, merely adds to the burdens of life. In such cases there would be no difference between regular working days and one’s holidays during which we should have some change in our occupation and enrich our minds in one way or the other.

Of course, too much leisure means mere idleness and is hardly helpful in one’s life. Leisure and rest are appreciated only when there is enough work during the rest of the week or the month. Excess or surfeit of leisure is, therefore, inadvisable; there must be a sense of proportion, that is, a period of sustained work, followed by a break or rest or change, to refresh the mind and the body. Strain during days or hours of leisure defeats the very purpose of providing leisure and giving holidays.

Typical examples of people merely wasting their leisure are provided by the country’s youth who have many weeks of vacation every year from the colleges and universities but do little constructive work either for their own mental and intellectual enrichment or for the social good.

Efforts have been made at many centres of education to persuade the students to take to useful activity, according to their taste or preference, during the long summer vacations, but very limited success has been achieved in this area. Our youth prefer to waste time in gossip, scandalous talk personal, defamatory or libellous conversation, outright censure and condemnation on of everyone else, not excluding their own teachers principals, and sometimes their parents. That, surely, is gross abuse of precious leisure."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"All the talk of “enjoying” one’s holidays contains many wrong notions about leisure. One can “enjoy” leisure even while doing some other useful work, such as social service, helping the weak, the handicapped elder and the hapless, educating the illiterate. In our country the vast majority urgently needs instruction and enlightenment from those who are better placed in life and has had the benefit of education.

And yet it is the height of callousness and a distinct failure of one’s duty as a wide awake citizen if we are selfish and ignore our social responsibility because their is no punishment of any kind yet devised by even the most powerful administrator or dictator for those who “kill” time and waste their leisure But this does not mean that we should become irresponsible and wasteful or that we would behave and conduct ourselves better only under the fear of some punishment.

A person’s mental, moral and intellectual development can be judge by this yardstick. Does he know how to make the best possible use leisure? Of course there is no uniformity in this area’ people can, and d use their leisure hours differently depending upon their circumstances. But while a good intelligent citizen uses his leisure gainfully, a bad, careless and irresponsible citizen merely wastes his time when there is leisure.

Example has been known in history of people who have utilized their leisure to overcome their crippling weakness and handicaps. The story goes that in ancient Greece, Demosthenes, who was a stammered and was conscious of his handicap even though he wanted to become a great orator, overcame his handicap during his spare time by putting pebbles in his mouth, shouting and speaking hour after hour against the noise of the sea waves."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Leisure is defined as freedom from the demands of work or duty.  Everybody needs leisure in their lives, to balance the stress of work and life.  Leisure helps re-energize and relax people, so they can perform activities well in their lives.  People use their free time (leisure time) in a variety of different ways; engaging in outdoor activities, entertainment like watching movies or television, or just having time to themselves..  Another activity people enjoy doing is just socializing with family and friends.  Leisure is an essential part of our lives, and the only problem with leisure iswhen can we enjoy it?  In our society we have a hard time finding time to relax and take
a break from our stressful lives.
The amount of leisure time a person has can be related to the type of person that
certain individual is.  There are many factors in which you can take in account: age,
marital status, gender, families, etc.  These factors figure into the certain stage of a
persons life.  There are three stages, beginning, mid-career, and near-retirement.  The
beginning stage involves people from the ages ranging from 19-30 years old. These
individuals are just beginning their careers and are striving to be successful.  They spend
better over the years.  During the mid-career stage people’s focuses change, because
work is not the focal point of their lives.  Families are getting started and that now shifts
a persons focus. During this stage, like I said before work is not the only priority, now
people are looking to take that vacation and taking shorter hours to be able to relax and
spend time with their family.  The near retirement stage is the best time to catch up on
your leisure time.  People are not working long hours, they spending more time doing
other activities.  In this stage of a persons life they are trying to finalize what they are
going to do with all their free time.  The stages basically go from no time to a whole lot
of free time. Leisure is important in our society, because it helps people escape from their
more time focusing on their job, trying to find ways to advance, and less time relaxing
and enjoying leisure time.  They compensate their leisure time for their careers.
Mid-career stage includes individuals ranging from 30-50 years old.  In this stage people
have been in their field for some years and are settled down with families.  In this time of
their lives they will be looking for more leisure time, because they are going to want time"

The near-retirement stage are individuals ranging from the ages of 50 and up.  These people are on the verge of retirement and are planning what to do with the rest of their lives. 

After their careers are over they are going to have nothing but time on they hands. At this point of there careers they are working lesser hours and responsibility at their job is decreasing. This helps make the transition from working to retirement much easier.  I made a survey and issued it to three people who fall into the three stages. The survey consisted of a variety of question like age, gender, occupation, wages, leisure time, and activities. The first individual who took the survey fell into the beginning stage. 

This person is a twenty one year old black male.  He is a full time student at Illinois State and workers part time as a life guard at a indoor pool.  He is not married and has no children. He works twenty plus hours a week and only makes $6.30 a hour. He works five days a week, but sometimes takes morning shifts on Saturdays.  He considered leisure as any time away from work and school.  He said he does not get a lot of leisure time, because he does not have any time to just relax.  He has class all morning then in the evening he works and comes home and studies.  The only leisure time he has is over

,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Leisure Time Essay – Introduction: Leisure is that sweetest of moments when a man has nothing specific to do. When he is his own master and can dispose of his spare time at his own suit will.
Meaning of leisure: Leisure does not refer to idleness or laziness but it refers to relief or relaxes for a short period from the monotony of daily routine. It is not a non-activity but it implies an activity which is meaningful, potential and enjoyable: It is for its own sake as it is a period of personal fulfillment and pleasure. It is, so to speak, freedom of monotony, boredom, and drudgery of life.

The present time is a time of automation, better standard of living and longevity has further broadened and liberalized the real conception of leisure. The strange and wonderful invention of science and technology has also reduced the hour of working and consequently man has now found a lot of time to enjoy leisure at his suit will. In fact, very few people are aware of making the proper utilization of leisure. Different people spend it in different ways, They have no proper sense or idea of it due to their ignorance, whim or uncared habit. To many others, leisure is a time to make creative and aesthetic pursuit and inner fulfillment."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"today’s leisure: Today’s leisure is spent in various ways People are rightly found in spending their leisures, watching T.V. The craze and popularity of TV is increasing day by day. A great part of their time is spent not in manly thing but in viewing programs in the idle box.

Such a craze and popularity of T.V. has created many socials, psychological, physical, family, individual and mental problems. That’s why, leisure spent watching TV, enjoying cinema shows, and other lengthy interesting things may marginalize towards reading, social activities, and outdoor habits/hobbies to a great extent."

,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"The enjoyable leisure: Truly speaking, leisure is enjoyable in relation to one’s work. After a day’s hard and toilsome work, one needs to enjoy leisure the most. In absence of work, no leisure can truly be conceived. Leisure is a kind of diversion which pre-supposes work and labor. Rest is much sweeter than honey and money after exertion and exhaustion.

Totem Our life: Our life is now more free and leisurely than our forefathers. Now people have found out to spend their leisure time. There are interesting serials, spicy films scientific music, dances, shows, plays various types of information weather forecasts, different types of interviews, analysis of events, happenings and Incidents and many other things at twenty-four hours of the day. There are many sources of channels to choose from.

Necessity: Man is under the necessity of leisure. After a tiresome work a period of leisure makes a man fresh, energetic, and stimulates him to finish the unfinished work. One can spend leisurein taking snacks at a restaurant, tea, cofee and other edible things At leisure one can engage oneself in meditation and religious practice. The great men all over the world in the past and even at present spent and now spend their respective leisures in meditation in pursuit of knowledge, constructive ideas, benevolence for the well-being of mankind. Leisure in man’s life is as essential as food but its proper utilization in the fruitful way is wanted.

,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that improve the mind, such as reading and doing word puzzles. Other people feel that it is important to rest the mind during leisure time. Discuss.

Leisure time is much important for all humans, because every one need to release their stress of work and everyday life. Personally, I am using my free time for relaxing and listening music, because I am a job holder and I need to have keep my limbs freely and I need refresh my mind, but leisure time can be used for various reasons.

Some people like to have their free time by watching movies, reading or brows internet. These types of activities may be help to release their stress and they can refresh their mind. I have an experience about this situation, when I was studying my degree course, I liked to spend my free time for playing basket ball and cricket, because I need to keep my physical fitness in good condition.

Job is another factor, which also effect our leisure time. Software Engineer, for example, he has been spending his work until complete of his target or software. Hence, he wants to siting in front of his computer and need to program his software and he needs to directly face to computer screen log time. Then, end of the working day he would like to have relax in a comfortable chair.

Working place also may effect our leisure time. People, who work in indoors, they like to have their leisure time in outdoors also reverse same for the outdoor workers. I am job holder in a university and all the time I am working in my room, so I like to visit beautiful places and stay with listening music.

Person condition also depend on their free time activities. Pregnant mothers, patients they like to have rest during the free times. Elderly people, who like to read books, listening radio, watch television etc.,

In conclusion, people would like to spend their leisure time by choosing best for them. This is depending on their work, job, condition etc,. In my opinion is, it needs to be helped to our future success."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Wordsworth had correctly said that getting and spending we lay waste our power. We have, virtually, no time to enjoy the beauty of nature, spend carefree moments with friends or relatives and spare from our busy routine some time for leisure.

This makes a poet bemoan:

What is this life, if full of care,

We have no time to stand and stare?

Caught as we are in a rat-race in this highly competitive, capitalist society, it is all the more essential to get out of it for at least an hour or so and do something quite different from the daily grind of life. Leisure provides rest and relaxation.

To turn one’s mind to something else, that one enjoys doing, is a happy end to a day’s hard work. It provides you with an opportunity to get rid of the tensions and pressures at your place of work and make you feel relaxed.

There are different ways of deriving leisure. You can engage in a hobby of your choice, such as reading, gardening, stamp-collecting, photography, social work or anything else. The pursuance of a hobby, like reading, enlightens the mind, since it has always to offer something new. Reading broadens the outlook and often shows us the side of life that we have not been exposed to.

Gardening not only helps you to exert yourself physically, but teaches you to appreciate the unique colours of nature. Stamp-collecting arouses your interest in different countries and teaches you a lot about them. Photography enables you to be creative and social work gives immense satisfaction, as you help another man to improve his life.

So we can rightly say that every hobby provides a welcome relief from work. It is the only hour of the day, when you can do what you have always wanted to do, but never found time to do it in your busy life. In fact, even cleaning up the cupboard, which you have not done for a long time, can often be found quite interesting.

You come across objects which you had considered lost and forgotten. Those objects might be linked to pleasant or unpleasant experiences, transforming you back into the memory lane, which itself are a pleasurable experience."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Another, usually, long-neglected occupation, one can engage in, is writing letters to people who have either written to you or are waiting for your response. This helps revive links, apart from giving you an occasion to spend your leisure time profitably.

Another easy way to relax is to go out of the house, do window-shopping, or merely walk in a park and watch the children at play. Anything that is different from the daily routine and that you enjoy doing is a good way of spending your leisure hours. Leisure, undoubtedly, is an invaluable, ideal tonic that provides solace, joy and happiness to the mind as well as body."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Leisure is the free time one gets in the course of the day or after the work for the day is over. In the busy and hectic life of today, not every body has the time for leisure. Still leisure remains a very important part of life.
You must have heard the saying that all work and no play makes you dull, it is very true in the context of our modern civilization. It seems as if we all are a part of the rat race. It is essential for all of us to get out of this rat race at least for an hour or so and turn our mind towards something else which is quite different from the daily routine of life. Nornal is so boring and hence doing something which is different from the routine is essential to get rid of the boredom that we have in our life.
Leisure provides rest and relaxation to our mind and body. To turn one’s mind to something else that one enjoys doing is a happy end to a day’s work. One can easily forget the tensoin and the pressure at the place of work and divert the mind in a creative and constructive manner."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"There are various ways of spending the leisure time. One can engage himself in a hobby which he enjoys such as reading, gardening, stamp collecting, photography, cooking, social work or anything else. Now a days, I am busy with my new found hobby of blogging. Every hobby enlightens the mind as one always keeps learning new things. Reading broadens our outlook and often shows us a side of life that we have never been exposed to. Gardening, not only gives us a lot of physical exercise but also teaches us to appreciate the unique beauty of nature. Stamp collecting arouses our interest in various countries and we also get to learn a lot about them. Photography allows one to be creative and social work gives immence satisfaction as one person helps another person to improve his life. Thus every hobby provides a welcome relief from one’s work. It is the one hour of the day when one can do what one has always wanted to do, but never finds the time to do in one’s busy life. Infact, cleaning up one’s cupboard, kitchen, living room or evrn toilet which one has not done for a long time can be an interesting experience. One comes across things which one had considered lost and forgotten. Those objects might be linked with pleasant or unpleasant experiences of the past and one can just sit and go down the memory lane, which in itself is a very pleasurable experience. We get an immence sence of satisfaction and achievement. Another usually long neglected occupation one can engage in is writing leters to people who have either written and are waiting for a response, or those who one should should have written anyway. Just ask yourself, in todays internet age, how many people write letters to friends and relatives. When was the last time you had written a letter to a friend or a relative? You are not able to recall, right? Isn’t letter writing a great hobby? It helps revive old links and at the same time one feels content of spending one’s leisure time in a profitable manner.

Yet another way to relax is go out of the house – do window shopping or merely walk in a park and watch children play. During evening hours, I often go out to the nearby mall with my friends, do a bit of window shopping and have a cup of coffee or an ice cream or a fountain. Anything waht is different from the daily routine and that one enjoys doing is a good way of spending one’s leisure hours."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"The importance of leisure can never be exaggerated. It helps to break all barriers and come out of she shell in which one remains confined. By spending good time at leisure, one can have a healthy mind and spirit. Infact, our forefathers who were free from the work load and tensions of the modern life and had a leisurely way of life, were also free from the problems and diseases caused by the stressful living such as anxiety, High blood pressure, heart problems and so on. We people, who cannot lead a leisurely way of life, can atleast spare an hour of leisure a day. Please consider reading the following poem by William Henry Davies.
LEISURE
What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare?

No time to stand beneath the boughs,
And stare as long as sheep and cows:

No time to see, when woods we pass,
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass:

No time to see, in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night:

No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance:

No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began?

A poor life this if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare

,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Leisure is the spare time when one has nothing specific to do, no work to occupy his time and, hence, one is not in a hurry.
Leisure is important for every person. It gives him the respite from the monotony and drudgery of routine duties that occupy the greater part of our time. There is not even one among us who does not feel relaxed and happy on Sundays and holidays. When there is no compulsion, we are more free and less reluctant to use our time in accordance with our inclinations.
There are people who would like to idle away their time on holidays, for they find their leisure too short to be spent o anything more meaningful than yawning, dozing, enjoying siesta, gossiping and playing cards. This way they get only more bored and when they get back to their work they are anything but refreshed. There are still others who retire into a solitary nook and mope about brooding on their frustrating experiences or on the monotony of their routine work. This too is not the right way of using the leisure, for its aim is not to become willing prey to boredom. The importance of leisure lies in overcoming the sickening influences of boredom.
Often the students are found revising their lessons, the others looking through their office files at their leisure, for they think they should utilize their free time. The don’t understand the importance of leisure. It’s a pity they do not know what to do with their leisure. You should recharge yourself during the leisure time.
What then should one do at his leisure? It depends on the length of time. If the leisure is but of a few hours, or a day or two, it is not possible to make plans for spending it in some way or other. For example, we cannot think of using the leisure between evening when we get back home and the time when we usually go to bed. Even for Sundays we cannot make much of a plan, for the Mondays are always there staring us in the face.
We can think of going sight-seeing in the countryside. We should understand the importance of listening to the birds’ songs and lying down in the green field.
However, for a day or two it is difficult to find the patch of green where we can lie down under the caressing, cool shades of trees in the neighborhood. So it is better to stay where we are and to spend our day with the family and friends. We can even look beyond our cramped existence and organize community programs for amusements and entertainments."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"Leisure means the 'free time', the time at one's disposal. We have no time to stop look around us. We beign our day with the tensions of work and end it with those of traffic jams and power - cuts.
For many of us there is no escape from this situation, but our lives would be different if we thtook ten minutes off from our busy schedules to admire a butterfly, smell a flower or listen to the song of birds. Some of us may even like to just sit down alone and be with out thoughts.
The physical and mental system of man gets tried and exhausted unless it has occasional rest after every few hours. Sleep is complusary leisure enforced by mother nature. 
Indeed, leisure is almost as necessary for life as food and exercise. But the human mind cannot remain altogether vacant. Reading light books, enjoying games and shows, sight - seeing, visiting friends at pleasure, even merely sitting in the open, gazing at natural beauties or children at play-all these are good ways of spending one's leisure. The man who works sincerely can enjoy his leisure fruitful. It promotes his skill and makes him more enterprising. So, leisure is not entertaining but also invigorating. However, a man may enjoy his leisure hours in different ways. But misuse of leisure is not desirable. In fact, leisure is valuable for a hard worker but is quite useless to an idle person... "
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"How I spend my leisure time:
Free time is a something everybody needs.   Free time always people to express themselves in many different ways.   Moreover, some people can become so busy in life they don’t have time for free time, which may seems impossible to some.   Furthermore, most people set aside a time where they are free to do whatever it is they enjoy doing.   I on the other hand, love and enjoy free time; I spend my free time doing things that makes me happy.   Three ways I spend my free time is being around my family, shopping, and resting. First, I belong to a religious type of family. I recites the Holy Quran with translation in my leisure time which makes me a strong believer of Allah. I read books or novels in my leisure time. I read grammar book for the improvement of my English. Next, I love being around my family they are the beat to my heart. When I am with my family I feel comfort.   For example, I would say my family is an example of “The Cosby Family.” We have our ups and downs but we still love each other.   In addition, my family is a religious family and I think that plays apart in way we are so close to one another.   My grandfather makes sure that everyone is outside every Sunday and we enjoy going as well. My is and will always be a part of my free time,

In last, I spend a lot of my free time shopping.   Shopping is something I can do all day every day.   For instance, I can spend up to four to six hours in one store.   Last year when I got my taxes back think I went to different shopping centers every day of the week.   Furthermore, I don’t even have to buy anything I enjoy seeing different kinds of clothes and etc. Sometime I will sit on my laptop and look up different fashion website and not have dime to purchase anything. Shopping is something I think inherited from my grandmother, which may not even be possible but is a common interest that we share. That’s how I spend my leisure time."
,,,,,leisure activities,,,,,,,,,"There are many things I enjoy doing in my leisure time, but the one thing I always look forward to is being in the outdoors. I enjoy going out to my lake lot, relaxing and going on the back trails. I love being near the water all day and every day. If it were up to me, I would live out there. There are so many activities you can do, quading, hunting, fishing, walking, wakeboarding, water skiing, and most importantly enjoying the fresh air. These are just a few activities that you can do in the outdoors. Hunting, fishing, and quading are by far the most enjoyable activity I prefer out of all of them. I personally can say for myself I very much do appreciate spending most of my time outdoors with family and friends. The outdoors is a place where you can really take in nature and its fresh clean air. 
Throughout my childhood, I was always the outdoorsy type. I used to go outside and make little forts and run around and play. As I got older, I find that I’ve really taken to the hunting.  Hunting to me is just something I really appreciate. I enjoy the challenge of just being near the wildlife and observing the environment all around me. For the most part, hunting is about getting out and calling out the animals and just seeing what’s out there. It does not even have to be about taking an animal.

Quading is more of an adventurous and exciting way to kill the day. Driving through the muskeg, and splashing through the water are just two of many things I enjoy about quading. This is another leisurely activity I can also do with family and friends. Whether It is mud bogging or just back trail riding it is always a good time. Being at our cabin all the time, you almost have to quad everywhere to get where you want to go. This is what I like to do. If I want to go fish at the pier, I can load up my quad and go. I love the freedom of being my own ride to where I want to"

Furthermore, during the winter months, basketball was the only sport I had access too because there were indoor courts available. These environmental factors inclined me to choose basketball as my main recreation in terms of competitive sport and now it is one of my favorite sports. It was hard for me to engage in my previous recreational activities because nobody enjoyed playing soccer or cricket. This constrained my choices in terms of what kind of recreational activities I wanted to do. Another factor that separated me from playing sports such as soccer and cricket were economic factors. During the winter season, the only way I could play these sports was if I joined the indoor leagues but these leagues were quite expensive. Coming from a middle class family, these extra expenses were hard to manage and sustain. Soon it became too much and so I had to quit and find other recreational activities to do in my leisure. Due to these various sociocultural factors, my involvement in certain sports was severely hampered while other sports such as basketball were immensely facilitated.



Another environmental factor that really controls when I do my leisure is the area or locality where I live. I do not live in  a prestigious area and thus there are many things lacking such as recreation centers and gyms. Your built environment influences how physically active you are because you are more likely engage in healthy recreational activities if they are close and"
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"As in music and films I’m a melomaniac. I watch different genres of movies. From scary horror film to romantic comedies. When I was asked about my favorite film, I realized that I had never thought about it. I didn't stop at one film.
First movie it is drama. ""Me before you"". This story touched me to my heart.
During watching this film I was feeling joy, happiness, confusion, sadness and disappointment. This story about Will Traynor who became quadriplegic. He was disappointed in his life. And his mother hired a new nurse for him. It was Louise Clark who tried to show him the joy of his life. By the end of the film she had fallen in love with Will and their feelings were mutual. I love the actress Emilia Clarke and this role (Louise) is no exception. Spoiler! The ending of the story is very tragic.
The second film, it's ""It"". This is a horror movie, based on the novel by Stephen King. It is a story about seven kid were friends of children who fought against evil in the form of a clown with red balloons, its name is Рennywise. Which killed the brother of one of the friends, and altogether many children died because of it. This film is about courage, determination, and overcoming fear. For me, it's not very scary, but it's insanely interesting. I recommend watching not only the movie but also reading the book!"
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"My favorite movie is more modern, although it was released on TV screens a long time ago - it's ""One at Home"". ""One at Home"" is a fun family comedy. We love watching it with our parents. Throughout the film, we sincerely laugh at the fun adventures of the main character Kevin. I felt very sorry for him when he was left alone at home, he thought that everyone had abandoned him. He was very angry and offended until he realized that his dearest house wanted to rob. Then Kevin gathered his strength and proudly defended his home. How cleverly he came up with all those intricate traps into which the robbers fell. I did not feel sorry for them at all, they deserved to be treated badly.
The film makes you think about the true values ​​of the family and how mothers feel about their children. At the very end of the film, the whole family was together, and Christmas was spent with presents and in the family circle."

After the world ""Titanic"" died down on the screens, James Cameron literally went to the bottom, carried away by diving into the depths of the ocean. For twelve long years, he did not shoot anything for Hollywood, only releasing several documentaries about his underwater expeditions. They waited long and hard for the fantastic action movie ""Avatar"", and finally, in 2009, the world saw this large-scale project. Now we invite you to watch the picture ""Avatar"" online and become one of the multi-million army of fans of this fascinating story.The plot of the film is simple, but at the same time the project amazes with its technical side, which turned the world of cinema upside down, marking the era of a new digital boom. The story tells about Jake Sully, who was deprived of the opportunity to walk as a retired Marine. Tragically, his twin brother, who was supposed to be part of an alien project, is killed in a street fight. Instead, Jake is given the opportunity to become the operator of the so-called ""avatar"", an artificially grown hybrid of a human and an alien Na'vi creature. Wanting to part with his inferiority, the former soldier with hope in his heart goes to the distant planet Pandora."

Each film has different genre like there are social, historical, science, fiction, documentary based, religious, thriller or horror movies. I also like to watch movies in my spare time.According to me, a good movie is the one in which we can relate with the characters and share the excitement or sorrows."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"The movie that I like the most is “Taarezameen per”.It is my favorite movie and I have seen it so many times. There are no bold scenes in this movie and people of every age can watch it. This is my favorite movie because the story is very touching. This movie is both entertaining and educational. All the characters have acted so well in this movie. It is an emotional movie which always keeps me glued to the screen. It tells about the story of a boy who suffers from dyslexia due to which he is unable to identify speech sounds and how they relate to letters. Because of this disorder, he cannot excel in any activity.  He finds all the subjects difficult to study. Even with this disorder, he is very good at painting.However, he gets expelled from school because of his poor performance. All the teachers tell his parents that their boy is not normal and he should be sent to school which is especially made for special children like him. Later, his parents send him to boarding school. There he sinks into a state of nervousness and fear because of new environment. Fortunately, he finds an art teacher there who is very supportive and caring. His teacher realizes that it is not ishaan’s fault to get bad grades but a disorder which makes it difficult for him to focus. He visits ishaan’s home and gets surprised to see his drawings. He also gets to know that ishaan’s dad does not understand him and often shouts at him for not getting good grades. Because of this, ishaan no longer paints and suffers from anxiety. He gets motivated to improve ishaan’s writing and reading by using techniques developed by dyslexia specialists.

"
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"These techniques help ishaan to score good grades in school. In the end, he also wins a painting competition because of his striking creative style.

I like how this story is relevant in today’s society. According to me, this is a movie which gives best moral to parents, teachers and every child.

It is a marvelous piece of work which shows a perfect relationship between a teacher and a student. It highlights the issue that sometimes, parents do not understand that every kid is different.

If he is not good at studies then there must be some other thing which he is good at. He might be interested in painting, acting, singing or sports. Therefore, parents should not discourage their children but help them in what they like.

I like how the director of this movie has brought out a clear message that parents should not ignore the interests of kids and they should not snatch their childhood from them by giving them burden of getting good grades or efficient performance in every field.

I just hope that this movie will change the thinking of parents and society.I have seen this movie so many times with my family.

Every aspect of this movie, from cast to location selection is amazing. All the actors have done an amazing job. I really cried while seeing this movie.I know, I will never get bored from this movie.

,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"I like to go to the cinema very much and I like to watch different films. My favourite genres are comedies and melodramas, but also I like fantasy.
I like different kinds of films, because each of them is very interesting and impresses me.
I like comedies because they make me laugh. Some of them are «Dad is 17 Again» , «Just Go with It», «Hitch». They are family films.
Melodramas are sad films. Such films excite people. I usually cry when I watch melodramas. Some of them are «A Walk to Remember», «If only», «Remember Me».
But my favorite film is «Harry Potter. I like all parts of this film. I think that it is the best one and all children and adults love Harry.
There are many computer drawings and special effects in this film.
«Harry Potter» is a very interesting fantasy novel about magicians. But we can see friendship and love in it.
I can watch «Harry Potter» again and again. I watched each of eight films with great interest.
This film teaches us much, I advice all people to watch it."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"One of my favourite pastimes, the one I have a particular liking for is going to the cinema.
Among different types of movies (like comedies, romantic dramas, adventures, police dramas or detective movies, psychological thrillers, horror movies or historical films) best of all I like detective movies and romantic dramas because most of such movies are interesting and full of life to me. But I also like good horror movies and I find them quite thrilling since my childhood.
But now I’d like to tell you about the movie that I find most pleasant to watch. It’s called “What Dreams May Come”. It is a 1998 American fantasy drama, starring Robin Williams. The film is based on the 1978 novel of the same name by Richard Matheson and was directed by Vincent Ward.
It’s a beautiful story about a married couple. Chris (Robin Williams) and Annie (Annabella Sciorra) play husband and wife.
They met by chance and fell in love immediately. They have two wonderful kids and a marriage full of love and life. But tragically, one day their kids are taken from them in a car accident.
They hold on to their lives and fight the sorrow, but one day, four years later, Chris’s life is also taken. He ends up in Heaven, but can’t accept his fate. A guide is sent to him, in the form of his friend Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.). Albert leads Chris on a journey through Heaven. In the real world, Annie can’t handle Chris’s death, and she kills herself and ends up in Hell. Chris must go on a journey to find her, and save her from an eternity of suffering.
This movie hits all the right chords. It makes you laugh and cry at times. The love Chris has for Annie is stronger than anything you have ever seen. He’s willing to lose his mind, and spend all eternity in Hell with her, with neither of them recognizing the other because they are soul mates, destined to be together for all the time.
This movie is hard to explain in any other way. The journey Chris goes through is remarkable, but the real star of this film is the visuals.
From the opening shot to the closing frame, it is magnificent. The story is enveloping encompassing nearly every asset of human emotion. It’s a roller–coaster ride but rewarding. Comedy, hope, sadness, joy, elation, despair… all displayed perfectly.
It’s a story about everlasting love and dreams that always come true."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"My favourite film is a science fiction trilogy The Matrix. The first part was shot in 1999, the second and the third – in 2003. I like this movie because it is dynamic, captivating and deeply philosophical at the same time. In my opinion, any good movie should be a combination of a touching story, bright visualization and clever ideas.
The Matrix is a cyberpunk story. The setting is the future where intelligent machines have enslaved the humanity. People are held on gigantic plantations and are used as a source of energy. They cannot fight against their enslavers because they are connected to a virtual reality called the Matrix.
They think that they live in the peaceful twenty-first century. But there is a small group of rebels who managed to escape from the Matrix. They try to destroy the machines. The main character Neo also becomes one of the rebels and uses his special powers in this war. In the end, though, he and his love Trinity die and the world of machines continues to exist.
The Matrix is directed by The Wachowskis – two talented and famous screenwriters and directors. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss play the roles of the main characters in the trilogy. The actors’ work is great, they show bright and plausible emotions. The computer visualization techniques are innovative (at the time) and very impressive.
I find the ideas of The Matrix deep and interesting. After watching the movie, I thought about it a lot. What if our world is a fake? If we have lived in a virtual reality from the first days of our life, how can we understand it? And finally, if we understand it, should we refuse from our ordinary life and fight? I think that these are deep philosophical questions. The Matrix is a grand movie that gave food for thought to millions of its viewers."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Usually we see films either in the cinema or on the TV. But from time to time I go to the cinema. My favourite film is «War and Peace». The script of the film was written by Sergey Bondarchuk and W. Solovyov. The Leningrad (now Sankt Petersburg) ballet dancer Lyudmila Savelieva played the main part. She played her role wonderfully. The other parts were played by A. Krotov (old Bolkonky), O. Tabakov (Nikolai), I. Skobzeva (Helena).
Borodino struggle, hunting, the first ball of Natasha made a great impression on me.
My favourite film Is «The Fate of a Man». This film is excellent. It is difficult to find other words to describe it. It has enormous vigor and delicacy, it is full of purity and hope.

… A man is caught in the storm of war and loses everything. Black clouds surround him, and yet he finds strength to bear up with it all; he finds strength to adopt a child, a destitute, helpless creature…» All the great events and the feelings aroused are depicted with taste, tact and restraint. I wish to draw attention particularly to the extraordinary performance of the boy. Even if the film has no other merits, the child scenes, so subtle, profound and lifelike, so full of tragic vigour — these scenes alone would win Bondarchuk the reputation of a great director."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"My favorite movie would have to be ""A Walk to Remember."" It was about an outwardly plain Christian girl named Jamie, and Landon, an aimless, reckless guy who breezed through school on looks and popularity. I liked this movie for many reasons. The main character, Jamie was not afraid of letting people know that her faith was the most important part of her life. That was very impressive to me. This movie also showed that it is possible for people to change their ways. Most of all it was a love story and that is my favorite kind of movie. 
             Jamie was true to her beliefs even though it was not cool. She was as far from cool as she could possibly be, but she didn't care. She was ridiculed all the time by other students. Her beliefs may have costed her some friends but she believed in God and that didn't change. She was very involved in school, with school plays and tutoring.
             The movie shows that it is possible for people to change. One night Landon was involved in a prank that landed one kid in the hospital. As punishment Landon had to tutor a young student at school and participate in the Drama Club's Spring play, two activities the principal hopes will teach him some humility. That led him into close contact with Jamie. He then had to ask her for help with his lines in the play. Jamie was the last person Landon was likely to fall for. But, against Landons own expectations, Landon finds himself falling in love with Jamie, who possesses a passion for life he never imagined possible. After the two become involved Landon didn't care what his friends thought and being popular wasn't important to him anymore. Landon even stood up to her dad, who was against Jamie even helping Landon out with his lines in the school play, and asked Jamie's dad if he could take her out to dinner one night. 
             This was a love story, but a sad one. Jamie was sick with leukemia. She does everything she can"

I had different tastes in books when I was younger as well. Even though my habits and reading preferences have changed over the years, I still enjoy it as much as I did as a youngster.
             My reading habits as a child were such that I'd read whenever I had free time. I'd read when I came home from school, and before I went to bed. I always had my nose in a book. I had a pretty large collection of books as well. For Birthday's and Christmas, I would make a list of new books I wanted. I'd rather receive books as gifts than toys!
             When I was younger, I enjoyed reading books by Judy Blume. She was my favorite author growing up. I read The Babysitter's Club series as well as books that had the option of choosing your own ending. I loved reading fictional books and I believe it was because I had such a creative imagination of my own. I could picture in my mind everything that I was reading.
             As an adult, my reading preference has changed in the sense that I read more of a variety. I enjoy fiction, as well as biographies, non-fiction and spiritual books. My reading habits have changed as well. I don't have the amount of time that I once had to read. I usually try to read 2 books per month, and I usually read during the weekend.
             My favorite author at the moment is Billie Letts. I have read 2 books written by her which were excellent. One of them, ""Where the Heart Is"", is actually one of my favorites. It was also made into a movie a few years ago. Although she writes fiction, her stories are realistic. She has another book that I have not yet read ""Shoot the Moon"" which I plan on choosing as the next book I'll read.

The main casts were Farhan Qureshi acted by R. Madhavan, Raju Rastogi acted by Sharman Joshi and Ranchoddas Shamaldas “Rancho” Chanchad acted by Aamir Khan.The main reason why I like love film, inspite of being a comedy carries a message and it’s about humanity. Other than that, I like this movie because it conveys about our schooling system. Nowadays, rote memorization isn't the only thing,it is the understanding of the subject that is needed more than that. It also conveys about expectations of parents and teachers from students. That it is about what one truly enjoys doing than to do what earns more. That grades are not everything.Moreover,In this movie it shows me that we must care and love our family. I really love my family. I always keep my promises for them, to raise them from poverty and to travel with them around the world. What I wanted for my family is to make them happy. Like Raju,we just want to free our family from poor quality that we had. Still I am happy though my family is striving crisis, because I believe that what important is, you are together with your family and you are having fun. This film influences me so much especially the quote “All is well” that always comes out from the mouth of Rancho.

And, personally I also like to watch movies of different genres in my leisure time. But ,among all the movies I had watched,the movie called 'Avengers Endgame' is my favourite movie.
Description about my favourite movie:
In the past few decades the science fiction and superhero movie genre became very popular among the people of different ages. But, currently the most successful superhero movie franchise is Marvel Cinematic Universe or popularly, MCU. 'Avengers Endgame' is the finale of the continuous storyline which was running through previous 21 movies, since 2008.
Reasons why I like this movie:
First of all the curiosity of knowing the ending of the long running storyline made me an instant fan of this movie even before it's release. And,after it's relase, it's massive cinematic scale, gorgeous storyline and inspirational, emotional feel made this my all time favourite movie.
Conclusion:
Although,many will say that superhero movies are imaginary and nonsense. But,if we watch these movies very sincerely we can relate them with our own lives.The ups and downs ,the success and faliure of a hero's journey is very much relatable."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Film is a means of creative expression. It performs the functions of mass media. Such as information, education, entertainment and transmission of culture. Films are widely popular and their audio visual nature provides them a pervasive power for social influence.

Therefore, they have the potential to play an important role as a medium of entertainment, information and education and as a catalyst for social change. Films are popular because they entertain.

They are a facet of a mass culture and mass art. They generate mass mediated culture arising from elite, folk, popular or mass origins.

,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Almost every person of the society has participated in the activity of going to cinema hall and enjoying a film. According to Jovett and Linton, “obviously there is still something unique and inherently appealing about going to the movies”, and this is clearly different from other mass media experiences”. (1989: 89).

The social institution of movie going is firmly established in our society and movies have played an important part as one of the factors contributing to the dramatic changes which have taken place in the last 50 years in the way we live and also in how we perceive the world around us.

They have provided us not only with entertainment, but also with ideas, and it would be difficult to conceive of our society without them.

The films take as their starting point those aspects of society with which we have become familiar. They create twist plots and use other narrative devices which infuse the story with sufficient new elements to attract an audience."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Films draw heavily from reality, portraying situations that have resemblance to the everyday stresses and aspirations of viewers’ lives. The movies recognize the link between their lives and films in both general and specific terms.

The ease of comprehension helps the viewer to assume the role of the characters and to identify with them quickly and effectively. Films appeal to their primary emotions and sentiments. Films provide photographic realism, vivid visual presentation in which the images are already fully established, easily identified and followed.

Melodrama in films draws suppressed fears and desires into a public realm, but suggests personal solutions. The viewers are active participants in the construction of the image that both represents present reality and allows them to escape as future fantasy.

Tudar (1969), pointed out that the darkened theatre, combined with the heightened intensity of the message stimuli, the increased sense of social isolation that it creates, and the relaxed posture of the movie viewer make the message more emotionally potent."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Thus, films leave lasting impression of the message. For example, films like Mother India, Naya Duar, Awara have their message still fresh in the minds of the people.

The films generate popular culture and create ‘culture waves. Such as in fashions styles and mannerisms. Moreover, by revolving the film stories and characters around the traditional ideas and role stereotypes, they foster the role stereotypes in the society in general.

Some of the films like ‘Bhigi Palkein,’ ‘Subah’, ‘Mrutyudand’ did try to show breaking role stereotypes and they were successful in conveying the message.

Roberge (1984) feels, “while cinema is acknowledged as a disseminator of popular culture, it is not described as, a “cultivator” but simply a ‘disseminator’ of culture. The contributory role of the cinema in cultivating and shaping culture is not acknowledged and it is perceived as a mere instrument or channel”."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"This implies that the cultural quality of cinema should be of good standard”. The cinema has always done a remarkable job in creating a type of visual public ‘consensus’.

Mass production and distribution of message systems transform selected private perspectives into broad public perspectives and brings mass public into existence.

Films combine visuals, movement, sound, theatre, music all in one. Therefore, they are able to communicate effectively and create impact which cannot be created by any other media. It is due to this characteristic of films; masses from all levels are attracted to go to cinema.

Due to reality element, films have psychological impact on people. The extent of reality that can be presented through films is far greater than television or any other medium. Their language is universal and this helps in breaking any social or cultural barriers."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Therefore, media experts and development communicators feel that films can prove to be the most effective mass medium in a country like India where literacy is low and people cannot afford other media such as print or television due to economic reasons.

Many people from lower economic status do not mind spending for films as it is the popular form of entertainment. Feature films are produced in several Indian languages. They provide a viable alternative to the people in terms of entertainment.

Since it is a powerful audio visual medium, social, cultural, political, communal problems can be projected well before the masses. Despite the growth of television and availability of other means of entertainment, films have remained the most popular medium of entertainment for the masses which is a basic necessity.

Thus, films can work as a social monitor. Films have been effective in projecting social evils, for example, the film ‘Yeh Aag Kub Bujegi’ well presented the evil of dowry, corrupt politicians in film like ‘Inquilabb’ and ‘Kissa Kursi Ka’ and so on.

Films have been exposing under world elements, black marketeers, bureaucrats, unemployment problem and so on.

According to Malhan, “Through characterization, demonstration and depiction of scenes and situations, it can even directly help to sell the concepts and norms of national or emotional integration,, dignity of labour, the bare-foot doctor or engineer, an understanding spouse and the pulls of extra-marital relations.”

They can stimulate values of good life and citizenship as also participatory virtues of developmental activities.

Each genera of film is capable of creating impact on the masses. For example, comedy and hilarious movies entertain people and relax them. Social or tragic movies provide outlet to the emotions of the viewers.

India has a history of hundred years of cinema. Indian films have been recognized nationally and internationally. Films in India have not only remained the medium of entertainment but film making has emerged as a major art form which is a creative expression of the film makers or artists."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Cinema is very common in India. Everyone is entertained by cinema and enjoys it for nearly three hours. Cinema came into existence in 1930. At first silent and black & white movies were made. After that coloured movies were made. Seeing a movie is not at all costly as compared to the other sources of entertainment. That is why everyone likes to see a film in a cinema hall. Cinema has its merits and demerits too. If a person sees a bad film then he can adopt all the bad points of the film. To see too much of films can spoil our eyesight, waste our money, time and energy. A person who be­comes a film fan wants to see every film at any cost, which is not at all good. Now-a-days cinema has become very popular and it is a good source of entertainment."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Since its beginning with the film ‘Raja Harish Chandra’ (1913), the cinema has remained the most powerful media for mass communication in India.

Since its beginning with the film ‘Raja Harish Chandra’ (1913), the cinema has remained the most powerful media for mass communication in India. Cinema has the ability to combine entertainment with communication of ideas. It has the potential appeal for its audience. It certainly leaves other media far behind in making such an appeal. As in literature, cinema ahs produced much which touches the innermost layers of the man. It mirrors the episodes in such a manner that leaves an impact on the coming generations. Cinema presents an image of the society in which it is born and the hopes, aspirations, frustration and contradictions present in any given social order.

There are variable views about the effects of cinema. Producers and financiers consider it as a tempting and lucrative business. For actors and actresses, it is a means to earn money and popularity among masses. The director, story-writer, song-writer and cinematographer take it as an art work. To some, it is an audio-visual translation of literatures and has its own message. As for government, it is a potential source of revenue and employment. For majority of cinema-goers, it is nothing but a cheap and interesting form of entertainment and pastime. Whatever may be the reason, cinema has occupied a major share of market for its cine lovers.

,,,,,"film
arts",,,,,,,,,"The term “essay film” has become increasingly used in film criticism to describe a self-reflective and self-referential documentary cinema that blurs the lines between fiction and nonfiction. Scholars unanimously agree that the first published use of the term was by Richter in 1940. Also uncontested is that Andre Bazin, in 1958, was the first to analyze a film, which was Marker’s Letter from Siberia (1958), according to the essay form. The French New Wave created a popularization of short essay films, and German New Cinema saw a resurgence in essay films due to a broad interest in examining German history. But beyond these origins of the term, scholars deviate on what exactly constitutes an essay film and how to categorize essay films. Generally, scholars fall into two camps: those who find a literary genealogy to the essay film and those who find a documentary genealogy to the essay film. The most commonly cited essay filmmakers are French and German: Marker, Resnais, Godard, and Farocki. These filmmakers are singled out for their breadth of essay film projects, as opposed to filmmakers who have made an essay film but who specialize in other genres. Though essay films have been and are being produced outside of the West, scholarship specifically addressing essay films focuses largely on France and Germany, although Solanas and Getino’s theory of “Third Cinema” and approval of certain French essay films has produced some essay film scholarship on Latin America. But the gap in scholarship on global essay film remains, with hope of being bridged by some forthcoming work. Since the term “essay film” is used so sparingly for specific films and filmmakers, the scholarship on essay film tends to take the form of single articles or chapters in either film theory or documentary anthologies and journals. Some recent scholarship has pointed out the evolutionary quality of essay films, emphasizing their ability to change form and style as a response to conventional filmmaking practices. The most recent scholarship and conference papers on essay film have shifted from an emphasis on literary essay to an emphasis on technology, arguing that essay film has the potential in the 21st century to present technology as self-conscious and self-reflexive of its role in art."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"I recently had a heated argument with a cinephile filmmaking friend about Chris Marker’s Sans soleil (1983). Having recently completed her first feature, and with such matters on her mind, my friend contended that the film’s power lay in its combinations of image and sound, irrespective of Marker’s inimitable voiceover narration. “Do you think that people who can’t understand English or French will get nothing out of the film?” she said; to which I – hot under the collar – replied that they might very well get something, but that something would not be the complete work.
The Sight & Sound Deep Focus season Thought in Action: The Art of the Essay Film runs at BFI Southbank 1-28 August 2013, with a keynote lecture by Kodwo Eshun on 1 August, a talk by writer and academic Laura Rascaroli on 27 August and a closing panel debate on 28 August.
To take this film-lovers’ tiff to a more elevated plane, what it suggests is that the essentialist conception of cinema is still present in cinephilic and critical culture, as are the difficulties of containing within it works that disrupt its very fabric. Ever since Vachel Lindsay published The Art of the Moving Picture in 1915 the quest to secure the autonomy of film as both medium and art – that ever-elusive ‘pure cinema’ – has been a preoccupation of film scholars, critics, cinephiles and filmmakers alike. My friend’s implicit derogation of the irreducible literary element of Sans soleil and her neo-Godardian invocation of ‘image and sound’ touch on that strain of this phenomenon which finds, in the technical-functional combination of those two elements, an alchemical, if not transubstantiational, result.

Mechanically created, cinema defies mechanism: it is poetic, transportive and, if not irrational, then a-rational. This mystically-minded view has a long and illustrious tradition in film history, stretching from the sense-deranging surrealists – who famously found accidental poetry in the juxtapositions created by randomly walking into and out of films; to the surrealist-influenced, scientifically trained and ontologically minded André Bazin, whose realist veneration of the long take centred on the very preternaturalness of nature as revealed by the unblinking gaze of the camera; to the trash-bin idolatry of the American underground, weaving new cinematic mythologies from Hollywood detritus; and to auteurism itself, which (in its more simplistic iterations) sees the essence of the filmmaker inscribed even upon the most compromised of works.

It isn’t going too far to claim that this tradition has constituted the foundation of cinephilic culture and helped to shape the cinematic canon itself. If Marker has now been welcomed into that canon and – thanks to the far greater availability of his work – into the mainstream of (primarily DVD-educated) cinephilia, it is rarely acknowledged how much of that work cheerfully undercuts many of the long-held assumptions and pieties upon which it is built.

In his review of Letter from Siberia (1957), Bazin placed Marker at right angles to cinema proper, describing the film’s “primary material” as intelligence – specifically a “verbal intelligence” – rather than image. He dubbed Marker’s method a “horizontal” montage, “as opposed to traditional montage that plays with the sense of duration through the relationship of shot to shot”.

Here, claimed Bazin, “a given image doesn’t refer to the one that preceded it or the one that will follow, but rather it refers laterally, in some way, to what is said.” Thus the very thing which makes Letter “extraordinary”, in Bazin’s estimation, is also what makes it not-cinema. Looking for a term to describe it, Bazin hit upon a prophetic turn of phrase, writing that Marker’s film is, “to borrow Jean Vigo’s formulation of À propos de Nice (‘a documentary point of view’), an essay documented by film. The important word is ‘essay’, understood in the same sense that it has in literature – an essay at once historical and political, written by a poet as well.”

Marker’s canonisation has proceeded apace with that of the form of which he has become the exemplar. Whether used as critical/curatorial shorthand in reviews and programme notes, employed as a model by filmmakers or examined in theoretical depth in major retrospectives (this summer’s BFI Southbank programme, for instance, follows upon Andréa Picard’s two-part series ‘The Way of the Termite’ at TIFF Cinémathèque in 2009-2010, which drew inspiration from Jean-Pierre Gorin’s groundbreaking programme of the same title at Vienna Filmmuseum in 2007), the ‘essay film’ has attained in recent years widespread recognition as a particular, if perennially porous, mode of film practice. An appealingly simple formulation, the term has proved both taxonomically useful and remarkably elastic, allowing one to define a field of previously unassimilable objects while ranging far and wide throughout film history to claim other previously identified objects for this invented tradition."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"It is crucial to note that the ‘essay film’ is not only a post-facto appellation for a kind of film practice that had not bothered to mark itself with a moniker, but also an invention and an intervention. While it has acquired its own set of canonical ‘texts’ that include the collected works of Marker, much of Godard – from the missive (the 52-minute Letter to Jane, 1972) to the massive (Histoire(s) de cinéma, 1988-98) – Welles’s F for Fake (1973) and Thom Andersen’s Los Angeles Plays Itself (2003), it has also poached on the territory of other, ‘sovereign’ forms, expanding its purview in accordance with the whims of its missionaries.

From documentary especially, Vigo’s aforementioned À propos de Nice, Ivens’s Rain (1929), Buñuel’s sardonic Las Hurdes (1933), Resnais’s Night and Fog (1955), Rouch and Morin’s Chronicle of a Summer (1961); from the avant garde, Akerman’s Je, Tu, Il, Elle (1974), Straub/Huillet’s Trop tôt, trop tard (1982); from agitprop, Getino and Solanas’s The Hour of the Furnaces (1968), Portabella’s Informe general… (1976); and even from ‘pure’ fiction, for example Gorin’s provocative selection of Griffith’s A Corner in Wheat (1909).

Just as within itself the essay film presents, in the words of Gorin, “the meandering of an intelligence that tries to multiply the entries and the exits into the material it has elected (or by which it has been elected),” so, without, its scope expands exponentially through the industrious activity of its adherents, blithely cutting across definitional borders and – as per the Manny Farberian concept which gave Gorin’s ‘Termite’ series its name –  creating meaning precisely by eating away at its own boundaries. In the scope of its application and its association more with an (amorphous) sensibility as opposed to fixed rules, the essay film bears similarities to the most famous of all fabricated genres: film noir, which has been located both in its natural habitat of the crime thriller as well as in such disparate climates as melodramas, westerns and science fiction.

The essay film, however, has proved even more peripatetic: where noir was formulated from the films of a determinate historical period (no matter that the temporal goalposts are continually shifted), the essay film is resolutely unfixed in time; it has its choice of forebears. And while noir, despite its occasional shadings over into semi-documentary during the 1940s, remains bound to fictional narratives, the essay film moves blithely between the realms of fiction and non-fiction, complicating the terms of both.

“Here is a form that seems to accommodate the two sides of that divide at the same time, that can navigate from documentary to fiction and back, creating other polarities in the process between which it can operate,” writes Gorin. When Orson Welles, in the closing moments of his masterful meditation on authenticity and illusion F for Fake, chortles, “I did promise that for one hour, I’d tell you only the truth. For the past 17 minutes, I’ve been lying my head off,” he is expressing both the conjuror’s pleasure in a trick well played and the artist’s delight in a self-defined mode that is cheerfully impure in both form and, perhaps, intention.

Nevertheless, as the essay film merrily traipses through celluloid history it intersects with ‘pure cinema’ at many turns and its form as such owes much to one particularly prominent variety thereof."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Swiss feature film is in full bloom. This has given it enormous opportu-nities for development that were not available yesterday. It is unpopular to  speak  of  documentary  film  at  such  a  moment;  but  it  may  be  excused  by the fact that it, too, has been experiencing an interesting development, albeit not due to an economic boom, but due to a certain zeitgeist.It has not been very long since it became generally known that a post-card is not an ideal model for a documentary film. But even today this point of view lingers on in some hearts, minds, and cameras (albeit hidden); and when  it  nevertheless  breaks  through,  acting  against  the  will  of  the  docu-mentary  filmmaker,  who  long  ago  renounced  this  falseness,  then  we  see  castles  bathed  in  moonlight,  romantic  perspectives,  idealized  shots,  and  completely artificial people on the screen.If we resist these bad habits, which the documentary film—to the detri-ment of its reputation—still lugs around, documentary film reveals possi-bilities that are at least as interesting as those of a feature film. To research these possibilities today is therefore an especially rewarding task, as every day they become more and more topical.The American [Robert] Flaherty led the way with his powerful epic film  (Nanook  of  the  North  and  Man  of  Aran).  He  portrays  the  great  human fight of man against nature—against cold, hunger, the ocean—in a simple matter-of-fact account. He has provided intellectual substance, not  just  pretty  views  (postcard  views),  and  with  his  splendid  solution"
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Was it the cast? Was it the storyline? Perhaps, it was the romance, musical and drama genre of the movie that you just couldn’t wait to watch it in the theatres.

Or was it simply because everyone hyped the movie so much that you decided to jump on the bandwagon too?

Let’s just say, all things aside, the movie was actually amazing.

Do you ever wonder though, what makes a good movie? Or what really drives up the numbers that determine a movie’s ultimate success?"
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Many people walked out of the cinema after watching the latest movie in the Mission Impossible series saying that they absolutely loved the action shown in the movie. Some even said the plot and storyline were extremly intriguing.

What do they really mean by that?

Just like us human beings, movies also have their own unique personalities. No two movies are the same, yet they can be similar in certain aspects. That similarity comes from the particular ‘genre’ of the movie.

Genre basically comes from a French word that means ‘type’, ‘kind’ or ‘category’. It refers to a set of similar, recurring and instantly –recognizable patterns, templates, themes and generic conventions.

How often do you find yourself saying to your friends on a Saturday night that you want to watch a horror movie? Or that you feel down and dreary so you want to watch a comedy to lighten yourself up?"
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"If you are to take a walk down history lane, you will find out that by the end of the Silent Era, some of the main genres were already fully established, including comedy, westerns, horror, action-adventure, and the melodrama. The musical genre came into existence with the ‘era of the Talkies’, while the genre of science-fiction or ‘sci-fi’ gained popularity by the time the 1950s rolled around.

Movie genres also underwent different stages of development, five to be exact, through cinematic history. The 5 stages include:

Primitive or Early
Classical or Traditional
Revisionist
Parodic
Extended or Mixed as Hybrid
Let the Genres Begin

If you really dig deep into the various types of movie genres that exist, you’ll be surprised to know that there are main film genres within which  there are further sub-genres, and then ‘other categories’ that no one particularly talks about.

Here is a list of the main and the most popular types of movie genres, explained in alphabetical order, with examples to make it easy for you to pick a movie on your movie night."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Just like the name aptly suggests, action-genre movies are literally characterized by a whole lot of action. These films are marked by continuous high energy, tremendous impact and a ton of big-budget physical stunts and activities.

Some of the most commonly-occurring scenes in Action movies include extended chases, battles, races, martial arts, rescues, explosions, fights, daring escapes, mountaineering, destructive disasters like fires and floods, and so much more. It is almost like non-stop motion that always keeps you on the edge of your seat.

In most Action films, the protagonist is usually found taking a risky turn which is what leads to the occurrence of highly-dramatized action scenes. With back-to-back action sequences happening at the core of such films, they are believed to have been designed for pure audience escapism. Some of the most popular Action movies include The Dark Knight, The Bourne Series, The James Bond Series, Mission Impossible series, etc."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"The adventure genre is often categorized with Action, resulting in a hybrid genre called “action-adventure”. This is primarily because the two genres have a lot in common and contain similar defining features.

Adventure movies, like action films are designed to provide an energetic and an action-filled experience to viewers through exciting stories and exotic locales. While actions films are predominantly marked by fighting and violence, adventure films help viewers live the film through the dramatic adventures faced by the protagonist of the movie, including travels, explorations, conquests, creation of empires, never-ending struggles and situations.


Adventure films often showcase historical periods that adapt stories of literary or historical adventure heroes, battles, kings, rebellions, etc. Some of the most brilliant adventure movies include Jurassic World, Mad max, Indianna Jones series  and many more."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Often referred to as the “make ‘em laugh” genre, the main purpose of comedy films is to elicit non-stop laughter from the audience and viewers. They are primarily crafted to entertain and amuse people, and also to induce a whole lot of enjoyment.

The comedy genre displays a story that makes use of comical events, and a series of funny situations, all intended to make the audience laugh. Comedy movies are typically referred to as light-hearted dramas that humorously exaggerate the language used in the movie, the characters and the overall situation.
Comedy movies offer people a momentary escape from their daily lives and allows them to indulge in bouts of merriment, mirth and tension-free enjoyment. According to the list 50 Greatest Comedies of All Time compiled by Premiere Magazine, some popular names include Sullivan’s Travels, The Lady Eye, and Trouble in Paradise.
"
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Also called gangster films, the crime genre revolves around sinister actions of gangsters and criminals who usually appear as underworld figures, bank robbers, or ruthless hooligans who break the law, steal, and murder their way through life.

Crime-genre films basically offer a view into the life of criminals, and go on to glorify the rise and fall of crime figures like murderers, lawbreakers, underground gangs, or people with personal power struggles.


Crime films are typically immoral, self-destructive, materialistic and meglo-maniacal. But if you look closely, crime and gangster also often make use of real-life gangsters, headline-grabbing situations, and real crime reports, in order to provide viewers with a clear view of the secret and dark world of criminals and gangsters. This genre is also characterized by things like piles of cash, lurid neon signs, sleazy bars, and seedy housing conditions.

Some must-watch crime movies include The Godfather, American Gangster, Prisoners, and The Dark Knight."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"The drama genre is true to its name, where it offers serious stories or representations coupled with life settings or situations in which realistic characters are shown being conflicted with themselves, with others, or with forces of nature.


Drama is also a genre of semi-fiction, or narrative fiction that is displayed in more serious tones and settings than humorous ones. A drama film often focuses on a characters’ battle or fights with their inner emotional struggles and may revolve around themes like societal ills, drug addiction, poverty, current issues, corruption of power, class divisions, violence towards women and many other such similar themes.

The main purpose served by drama films is to draw attention to such prevalent issues and societal problems by taking advantage of the interest of the subject. Some forms of the drama genre are melodrama, crime drama, military drama, teen drama, and many others.

A very famous and apt Drama film has to be The Good Earth (1973) which focuses on the problems of the dispossessed and the poor by showing Chinese peasants facing storms, famine and locusts."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Fantasy-based films are stories about supernatural forces and magic which take the audience to an imaginary world where anything is possible.  Such films are based on the context of imagination, dreams and even the hallucinations of a character that display elements of magic, wonder, myth, escapism and the extraordinary.

Fantasy films typically show heroes who undergo some form of mystical experiences and then have to resort to needing help from a powerful person, someone from the outside with superhuman powers and forces. Some of the most commonly occurring elements in fantasy films are magic swords and spells, flying carpets, dragons, ancient religious relics and many more. You may even get to see imaginary and super bizarre lands fairy tale settings, quirky locales and unreal world.

Some of the most predominant characters found in this genre are princes and princesses, fairies, angels, dwarves, magicians, gnomes, elves, and lesser gods.

One of the most famous and blockbuster fantasies of all times has to be The Harry Potter series. The books and movies alike are pure gold in terms of the plot, storyline, characters, and the overall sheer brilliance."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"This genre is a take on historical or imagined events, often including mythical, legendary or heroic figures with an added touch of lavish costumes, extravagant settings, and dramatized scenes.

Historical films are often stories about real persons and events, expressed in various forms like biographies, memoirs, and autobiographies. They also portray tales from the past that cover a large expanse of time usually set against panoramic backgrounds. You will often notice in most historical films that they make use of elaborate settings, on-location filming, authentic period costumes, excessive religiosity, leaden scripts, political correctness, romantic dream worlds, and sometimes vulgarity, too.

These films are typically meant to rewrite history, one that suffers from in-authenticity and fictitious recreations.

A few films that belong to the historical genre are Brave heart, Elizabeth, and Apollo 13."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Horror films are best defined as unsettling as well as disturbing, and are meant to create panic, fear, and feelings of dread among the audience. The horror genre primarily deals with techniques of violence, shock and suspense that invokes our worst and hidden fears but may also often provide us with a cathartic experience.

Unlike many genres, Horror goes as far back as the initial onset of films that basically happened some 100 years ago. Horror films are often set in spooky settings with scary old mansions, shadowy locales, and huge shrouded castles. Common characters found in the horror genre are monsters, vampires, ghosts, zombies, madmen, evil spirits, satanic villains, devils and possessed creatures.

Some forms of horror stories include ghost stories, myths, fables, and witchcraft horrors. What these really do is, while inducing pure terror among us and giving us an opening into that scary world out there; horror films are also super thrilling and often involve a fun factor for many people."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Also referred to as “dance films”, these films are cinematic renditions that display full-scale song and dance routines in a unique manner, often with dance or musical performances being the main narrative of the film. Some are also combinations of songs, music, dance and choreography.

Musicals are usually a way of highlighting various musical artists and dancing stars. The lyrics of such movies are found to be written in a way that they support the storyline. This genre, like many other movie genres is considered to be the most escapist of all because it offers a break and relief to the audience from unpleasant realities, characterized by a search for love, popularity, success, and wealth.

If you talk about the history of the musical genre, it basically stemmed from stage musicals, music halls, operettas, revues, musical comedies, vaudeville, and cabaret.

Lately, animated films like Beauty and The Beast, Tarzan, and The Lion King have been emerging as the major musical forms with their use of musical soundtracks in the films.
"
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"The mystery genre is typically fiction-based, which usually involves a detective or professional who often solves crimes or a series of crimes. The main purpose served by mystery genres is to solve puzzles and draw the viewers into the story through the art of pure suspense.

The plot of mystery movies usually begins with an insightful action like murder, followed by the protagonist, usually a detective who solves the mystery and saves the day. Such movies are full of heightened drama and suspense, along with dramatic plot twists.

A few must-watch movies for all mystery-lovers are The Illusionist, The Prestige and Memories of Murder.
"
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Needless to say, the romance genre in films deals with love stories and love affairs that center on the heart, human feelings, emotions, and romantic involvement of both the characters, often a man and a lady.

However, many a times, romances have been deemed to be historical romances, like those of Walter Scott where it has been described as “a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents.”

In most romantic films, however, you will see that the search for love is the main plot focus where the two lovers involved often have to face a series of obstacles and hindrances like financial struggles, hardships, physical illness, social class or racial status, psychological restrictions or opposition from the families.

The commonly observed themes explored by this genre involve essential themes of unrequited love, love at first sight, spiritual love, destructive love, etc. These films usually serve the purpose of being great escapes for viewers, as well as fantasies, shown through couples fighting for their love and overcoming life’s difficulties together.

If you are a fan of romance, you should definitely watch A Walk To Remember, The Notebook and Pride and Prejudice."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"This has to be among the more popular genres of movies, because sci-fi films are very scientific, of course. They are also super imaginative which is brilliantly shown through fanciful settings, advanced technology, expert film production design, exceptional special effects and amazing technology like  spaceships and robots.

This genre is quite similar to Fantasy, except that Sci-fi uses sheer scientific understanding to explain concepts like technological advancement, alternate universe, parallel universe, genetic engineering, travel through space, and alien-life forms, to name a few.

They are also a true depiction of unknown and explicable forces, shadowy villains, fantastic places, distant planets, technology and gizmos, etc.

Sci-fi genre sometimes also seeks to portray the menacing and dangerous nature of knowledge, basically including things that Man is not meant or supposed to know. A classical example of this is the brilliant movie Frankenstein (1931), which is defined as THE classic and monster film of all times. Modern Sci-fi includes the likes of Interstellar, Star Wars, Star Trek, The day the Earty stood still and many more."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"War films are often deemed as flag-waving propagandas, primarily designed to instill national pride and morale among viewers, and also to display acts of nobility of one’s own forces. These films also try to acknowledge the heartbreak and horror associated with wars where actual combat fighting against humankind or the nation is used as a primary plot or background in such films.

Commonly found elements in war movies include camp experiences and escapes, personal heroism, submarine warfare, espionages, brutalities of war, trench and infantry experiences and most importantly, the theme of friendship and affection that develops between war fighters during wartime.

This genre also came into existence in the Silent Era, the time when cinematic production had just begun. Many war films have used material from American history, including Vietnam War, French War, and Indian War.

The Birth of a Nation (1915) is believed to be one of the most brilliant depictions of the war genre and focuses on the effects of war on two families. The movie also included panoramic battle scenes and similar historical events that occurred during the Civil War era. Another notable movie that falls in this category is Full Metal Jacket, which gives us a depp dive into the soldiers battling the Vietnam War.

Now that you are familiar with most of the genres found in movies, which one do you really like and is your favorite?"

,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Let’s look at genre theory, what it entails, and how to start utilizing genres with a bit more practicality and creativity in your own projects.

One of the few rare things that one can actually learn in film school is the simple trick of taking a step back to view something you already know — through a new, academic lens. As filmmakers and film fans, we already know about film genres. It wasn’t until one of the first film theory classes I took that I actually learned how to view, deconstruct, and understand something as seemingly innate as genre.

Understanding “genre theory” is both very simple and very complex. In general, we all know the basics. The Hobbit is a fantasy book. Star Trek is a sci-fi television show. When Harry Met Sally is a rom-com. So, what do all those genre names actually mean? And, what exactly are the writers, filmmakers, and storytellers really doing to work within and against these modes?

Here’s a brief introduction into how filmmakers can understand and use “genre theory.”

What Are Film Genres?

A Guide to the Basic Film Genres (and How to Use Them) — Forbidden Planet Poster
A hybrid genre, Forbidden Planet is considered a drama/fantasy. Image via MGM.

Taking the word at its definition, genre is the “term for any category of literature or other forms of art or entertainment, e.g. music, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria.”

The term dates back to ancient Greek literature. But, for writers, artists, and filmmakers, it’s usually the simplest, most practical way to categorize different styles of stories and content. We see genres while browsing through video stores or scrolling through Netflix, giving us a rough idea of what the stories are like or similar to.

It’s important to understand, though, that what we consider film genres today are, more often than not, hardly pure film genres, as they were in the early days of film. The majority of content produced in the last several decades are often genre hybrids, using the rules of genre theory to produce new, unique, and different stories."
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"In the early days of cinema, genres were much more uniform and defined. Just as they were in literature and other forms of art and entertainment, people would go to the theater to watch a war film, a musical, or a comedy. The basic genres were well defined and included some of the following:

Action
Comedy
Drama
Fantasy
Horror
Mystery
Romance
Thriller
Western
From there, you could dive a bit deeper. Sub-genres were developed to give names and expectations to certain types of films within each genre. The “thriller” genre, for example, had the following sub-genres:

Crime Thriller
Disaster Thriller
Psychological Thriller
Techno Thriller
However, before we get too much into how to use film genres and begin mixing and matching them, let’s go over some of the biggest and most notable.

The Action Film Genre

A Guide to the Basic Film Genres (and How to Use Them) — Keanu Reeves in John Wick
The action genre has been a staple in epic filmmaking from the beginning of cinema. Image via Lionsgate.

One of the earliest film genres in existence, the action genre has close ties to classic strife and struggle narratives that you find across all manner of art and literature. With some of the earliest examples dating back to everything from historical war epics to some basic portrayals of dastardly train robberies, action films have been popular with cinema audiences since the very beginning. It’s also one of our best examples of the evolution of our cinematic hero’s journey and the classic hero vs. villain narratives, which you’ll find across cinema and genres.

Some of the main sub-genres include:

War and Military Action
Spy and Espionage Action
Martial Arts Action
Western Shoot ‘Em Up Action
Action Hybrid Genres

,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"A favorite genre of film audiences young and old, from the very beginning of cinema, the comedy genre has been a fun-loving, quite sophisticated, and innovative genre that’s delighted viewers for decades. Some of the biggest names in the history of filmmaking include comedy genre pioneers — like Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and Lucille Ball — who made successful careers out of finding new and unique ways to make audiences laugh. The comedy genre has also been one of the most flexible, as its roots have made their way into the very fabric of cinema and the many other genres contained within. The art of warming a heart and bringing a smile to a viewer’s face will never be lost, nor should it be considered anything but truly powerful.

Some of the main sub-genres include:

Slapstick Comedy
Screwball Comedy
Parody Comedy
Black Comedy

,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"While perhaps considered one of the more recent film genres to come into existence, elements of horror have long been a bedrock of classic cinema, dating back to some of the earliest — and eeriest — days of filmmaking. Examples like 1898’s Shinin No Sosei (Resurrection of a Corpse) come to mind, as well as several early horror iterations across the globe that captured the imagination of an audience hungry for creepy, occult fun. Taking cues from classic horror literature, big name horror franchises (of sorts) like Dracula and Frankenstein have existed within cinema for decades. However, it’s in the rise of newer horror genres featuring zombies, slashers, found footage, and haunted dolls that horror has really found its hold, from the 1970s into modern times.

Some of the main sub-genres include:

Zombie Horror
Folk Horror
Body Horror
Found Footage Horror"
,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"One of the most experimental and thought-provoking of the classic genres, the science-fiction (popularized as “sci-fi”) film genre goes all the way back to the silent film era. Some of the earliest films ever created focused on man’s fascination with outer space and the scientific unknown,  like the Georges Méliès film A Trip to the Moon (1902). The sci-fi genre has stayed strong throughout cinematic history, as film has remained one of the most popular mediums for showcasing mankind’s technical advancements, as well as a means to wrestle with higher concepts like alien life forms, artificial intelligence, and humanity’s place in the universe.

Some of the main sub-genres include:

,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"The western could technically be considered a sub-genre of the action film genre, in large part due to its huge popularity and its own exploits. Really, the various sub-genres within the western have essentially become classic film genres themselves.

In many ways, the western genre is very much the narrative of classic Hollywood, which pulled itself up by its own bootstraps to turn a recently settled California town into a pioneer of the modern movie industry. Westerns stampeded towards box office success throughout the early days of cinema, and well into the late 1960s and 1970s, before eventually transforming into some of our favorite modern blockbuster franchises.

Some of the main sub-genres include:

Classic Western
The Revisionist and Anti-Western
Contemporary and Neo-Western
Fantasy and Space Western
Modern Western

,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Ah, what would the great cinema tradition be if it weren’t for the countless stories of love and courtship. Since the advent of the movie theater experience, cinema has long been a favored pastime for couples looking to escape into a world of romance.

Similar to the action and comedy genres, the romance genre has become a central force in pretty much every other film genre under the sun. (Try to think of the last mainstream blockbuster you went to that didn’t have a love story at its core.) Still, even as early cinema was filled with classic romance examples and many hybridizations like the “rom-com,” the genre has certainly shifted over the years. Nonetheless, it remains a hugely significant genre for filmmakers and film fans, alike.

Historical Romance
Romantic Drama
Romantic Comedy
Chick Flick
Paranormal Romance

,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"Once a stylized niche genre, the thriller film has gone so mainstream that it might be time to change the genre’s name to Summer Blockbuster Event. The thriller’s rise coincides with the rise of the spy and detective pulp novels of the 1960s and 1970s. It’s been one of the best cinematic vehicles for exploring the sometimes upsetting and underrepresented truths about our governments and society at large. Owing some of its biggest successes to famous filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock, and including some of our favorite characters like James Bond, the thriller has become a popular and important part of the cinema tradition.

,,,,,film,,,,,,,,,"As the art of film evolved, more and more genres developed as filmmakers moved towards finding new and creative ways to subvert and combine them. Concepts like the “rom-com” appeared, combining the traditional genre elements of romance films and comedy films. Newer, more niche genres like the “road movie” and “disaster film” popped up alongside hybrid genres like “buddy cop” and “sci-fi western.”

By examining and mashing up genre theory, filmmakers have unlocked and combined different elements from disparate genres to create legendary results — like George Lucas’s Star Wars, which combines science fiction, samurai, western, and war genres, to name a few. Some take it further — Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction glides between genres chapter by chapter.

Genre theory is still very much a part of how we view and create films. However, genres are also in the process of being completely radicalized. It’s up to you to not just consume, but also strive to understand what other movies are doing. Then, apply your own research and inclinations toward the genres you choose to work with in your projects.
"
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Art has been a part of our life for as long as humanity has existed. For thousands of years people have been creating, looking at, criticizing, and enjoying art. I would like to address three questions: what is art, what is its purpose, and why has it survived for this long. 
             First, what is art? Humanity has faced this question for many centuries. How can we distinguish between fine art and a beautiful poster? How can we call both Malevich's ""Black Square"" and Da Vinci's ""La Joconde"" art, yet not include some people's paintings into this category? I believe that the only things that distinguish these works are the artist and the artist's objective. The connection between what the artist means to achieve and what he achieves through the medium is what I believe classifies art. If what the artist meant to say is understood by at least one person in this world, when we can safely call that piece art. What classifies a masterpiece, however, is when not only one person understands what the artist was trying to say with the piece but when the majority does. Many people believe that the fine arts are elitist. Nevertheless, art is not something that you have to study to understand and enjoy. Art is something that captures the eye. Whether the artist is trying to communicate an emotion, an idea or something else, the most important thing is how well the audience receives it. However, art can also be shocking, something new. If a creative piece by an artist can spark the discussion of whether that piece is art or not, then it is art. Art is something that inspires people, something that transports us into different realities and moves us into the subconscious places that we did not know existed. 
             What is the purpose of art? Art has some very practical purposes. For example, an art class might take a trip out to a local gallery simply for the purpose of looking at paintings and trying to reproduce"
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,," What is Art for? I don't believe there is a right or wrong answer to that question. I have heard on a couple of occasions that art is, ""good for nothing,"" I have also heard that art can express emotions that you are not willing to show with words. I believe that quote, ""a picture can say one thousand words"" backs that statement up.
             Personally, I do not hate art but I can also say that art really does not do anything for me anymore. Through personal experience, when I was younger I had liked to draw. In elementary school, I loved to go to art class. I drew a lot of things. My mother keeps all of my drawings. I mainly liked to draw cartoons. I was able to look at a picture off of a magazine (that I enjoyed to read) and draw that same picture. Sometimes it came out looking good but there were times where it did not look good. In my art class in elementary school, my art teacher introduced me to more than just drawing cartoons. He had me draw my hand without tracing over it like most people do. We made pottery and I remember drawing a replica of a tree.
             I have not drawn a picture in a long time. I might doodle here and 
             there, but nothing serious. I may draw when I am bored and have nothing 
             else to do. That is rare now-a-days because now I am always doing 
             sometime. If I am not at school I am at work. If I am not at work I am 
             doing school work. Then I have basketball practice. I really do not have 
             time anymore to draw anymore because I am always doing something."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"""Art is either plagiarism or revolution.""
             Paul Gauguin (1848–1903), French artist. Quoted in: Huneker, Pathos of Distance, p. 128. 
             Defining art is a very difficult thing to do. Choosing one characteristic over another would be unfair. Art and literature can't be based on good characteristics in a book or one way of painting or sculpting. You can't say that music is only good when it has words. So the question is what makes something art? Art can be defined as a unique style, something that has never been done before. 
             Everyone is different, even the most identical twin's don't share the same fingerprints. Everyone is also born with there own sense of style, there own thoughts and ideas. Art can not be art if you are coping other people's style. A not very well known book or piece of art can still be considered art as long as it holds it's own unique style. Take Pablo Picasso for example he changed modern art as we know it. Picasso didn't want people to copy him or his style. ""Painting is a blind man's profession. He paints not what he sees, but what he feels, what he tells himself about what he has seen."" Pablo Picasso From this quote I am led to believe that it's not his intentions for people to copy him. Art comes from within, you can't copy someone else and say that's how you feel. If you were to ask a 100 people what there feelings on art were, I bet that you wouldn't receive the same exact answer from any two people. So for someone to have the same style of someone else, is impossible. How can you feel, think or act out the same ways as someone else??? you can't. Oh, yes even Cow Poop Mary is art. The Virgin Mary has been done in many medians, but this artist seen something new something unique. It wasn't the same oil on canvas painting of the Virgin Mary holding baby Jesus. This had never been done before. And even"
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,," Art is only what the viewer brings to it whether it is sadness or enjoyment. Art exists as a sort of language, a means to communicate that, although less direct & specific than written or spoken language, is inclusive of more facets of human experience. Art is, therefore, less restricted than other types of binary communication because it calls into play more levels of personal experience, both subtly and explicitly. Art impacts individuals in numerous ways, and so doing directly impacts society. I think Art is at the center of society and shapes how we live, see, think, and interpret the world. Art can create mass outrage or sustenance depending on how the larger part of society understands and promotes the overall classification of a piece. For example, regardless of what apiece is the reviews affect how society reacts, if it were positive or negative! 
             I believe art oftentimes breaks down walls and teaching us we can't judge things as quickly as we are accustomed to. Even if a piece isn't received so kindly the more negative reaction it creates the more recognition it receives. Art definitely affects society by molding and twisting our own opinions to the point where the original discontent is masked by its inversely created excitement. I would say art isn't defined rigidly and doesn't have to fit in a single mold at all times. If it did, artists who pushed the boundaries like Picasso wouldn't be considered great throughout the art world. Art needs to be free to allow expression and experimentation. However, in some cases, art must fit a specific purpose, or accomplish a specific task. In those cases, some types of art are inappropriate. In those cases, it's possible to have ""bad art"" that otherwise might be considered good.
             I think for art to be good or bad, is all a matter of someone's opinion. Who is to say what is good or bad. Judging art is all perception and interpretation. "
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"In his essay, entitled ""Art,"" Clive Bell proposes that there is one
             element that coheres all works of art considered great in the world.
             ""There must be some one quality without which a work of art cannot exist;
             possessing which, in the least degree, no work is altogether worthless.
             What is this quality'"" In other words, Bell accepts that there must be
             some aesthetic standards by which to judge all works of art. However, Bell
             acknowledges that the body of art produced in and by the world's artists is
             multifaceted in its character, depending on the era when it was produced,
             the artist who produced it, and the medium in which it was produced.
             Early on in his essay, Bell states that to define the core query
             behind all of art criticism is to ask, ""What quality is shared by all
             objects that provoke our aesthetic emotions'"" It is not enough to say that
             adherence to reality or beauty is the standard, otherwise a functional
             Persian bowl might be ranked above a masterpiece of fruit in a bowl painted
             by Cézanne. Bell states, ""only one answer seems possible - significant
             form. In each, lines and colors combined in a particular way, certain forms
             and relations of forms, stir our aesthetic emotions.""
             Thus, although the use of the term significant form' might on its
             surface to suggest that the standards Bell judges works of art by are quite
             standardized. But really, what ""significant form"" means is the visceral
             yet aesthetic impression that a work of art is apt to have upon a gazer.
             This is why, for Bell, ""people who respond immediately and surely to works
             of artâ€in my judgment, [are] more enviable than men of massive intellect
             [who are] are often quite as incapable of talking sense about aesthetics.""
             Bell defends the common gazer, in essence, who looks upon a piece of art
             and intuitively responds to its construction. For instance, Bell might say
             that the"
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"  In the process of researching and comparing different works of art I chose to go to both Gilcrease and Philbrook museums. I believe the buildings and the surroundings of the buildings have a lot to do with how successful the museum is. Both museums have an elaborate entrance way which would lead the visitor to believe that once inside the same grandeur will continue. Upon entering Philbrook the awe from the exterior continued throughout the museum; on the other hand Gilcrease was rather disappointing to the viewer, especially after the beautiful entrance way. To me it looked as if most of their time has been spent on the exterior. 
             Gilcrease as a whole was an enormous let down; from the pieces of art to the way the pieces were light. The lighting gave Gilcrease a cold and crypt like feeling which made me rush through the museum. If there were any pieces of art with bright coloring or great detail the atmosphere was sure to kill it. Somehow in this gloomy environment I found six pieces of art that I enjoyed.
             The first piece of art that really caught my eye was El Galope which was painted in 1943 by Jose Chavez Morado. This oil painting has a tremendous amount of motion from the horses running to the direction the sky and ground flow. Almost everything in this painting flows from the top left hand corner in a circular motion to the bottom right hand corner. The only thing that isn't in the same flow are two of the riders; they are being thrown back from the force of the horses they are on which gives the since of urgency and motion to this painting. This painting gave me the feeling that three riders are headed to a fight since one has his weapon in hand and another has one on his back ready to draw at any time. As a whole this painting had a lot of action in it for being such a small painting.
             The second work of art I will discuss will be an oil on canvas by Nicolai Fechin titled Still Life With Calla Lilies. "
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Artists will use their unique form of artwork to pass along their views and feelings. The importance and value of art and the artist to society has remained constant throughout history. An innovative way of viewing the world or society around us is produced by the artist through his/her art. Interpreting art depends on a person or artist experiences, their associations, visionary thoughts and culture.

Art is just like love and has so many definitions and examples for each. Therefore, I believe that art is not about perfection; art is something that continues to develop and grow as it is seen, meaning to open all generations of emotions, thoughts and human capacities.

Art is a creation through observation and interpretation of the art and the portrayal of their craft by the artist in whatever way they want whether it is viewed the same way as the observer or any way they see it. Intelligible and recognized thoughts and emotions of the world is considered to be art. Within the emotions and thoughts of the world, art enables those experiences to be intelligible and recognized.

Watson’s famous painting is “Peace and love” where he uses the principle elements to deliver the message of love and peace. Colour is the most dominant and prominent element he uses in the painting. The colour blue is used by him to represent peace and the emotion notion that one may notice when one look at the piece. To support specific important aspect like love, power and strength among blacks, he uses a small amount of red throughout the piece. Brown is used to representing the feeling of home and its comfort. In the background, the use of blue by Watson with a hint of criss-cross lines that coupled with the subject’s hair adds non-tactile depth and texture to the painting.

The subject Rastafarian is used by Watson because Rastafarians are usually associated with peace and meditation. If art is considered to be an action, then the person who acts is known as an artist. A person who performs various activities and are considered to be art then the person in a descriptive term called an artist.
Communication through art is what the artist use in their craft and works. For the long term, Jamaican artists were known to portray strong feeling through their work and art. Each art and the work in its way represented some ideas, emotions or feelings in either two dimensional or three-dimensional forms.

The work of art can either be a real piece or an abstract one depicting or telling stories and ideas. For most people, a piece of art that seem to stir the feelings and emotions of the viewer considers the main enjoyment in art. "

,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Creating art relieves stress, encourages creative thinking, increases brain plasticity, and imparts other mental health benefits. And anyone can do art.

“Art washes from the soul the dust of everyday life.”
— Pablo Picasso

There are a lot of misconceptions about art.

Some think you have to create paintings or sculptures to be considered a real artist.

Others believe that you are either born with artistic talent, or not.

Many who don’t consider themselves to be gifted artistically feel that there is no point in creating art since they won’t be satisfied with the results.

Another myth is that you have to work with an art therapist to get any therapeutic benefit from creating art.

But we are all born with an innate desire to express ourselves and art encompasses a wider range of activities than you might imagine.

Here are some of the best ways in which creative expression can benefit mental health — making you a happier, healthier person.

HOW CREATING ART RELIEVES STRESS

Activities like painting, sculpting, drawing, and photography are relaxing and rewarding hobbies that can lower your stress level and leave you feeling mentally clear and calm.

Creating art provides a distraction, giving your brain a break from your usual thoughts.

The average person has roughly 60,000 thoughts per day and 90% of them are exactly the same, day in and day out! (1)

When you are totally immersed in a creative endeavor, you may find yourself in what’s known as “the zone” or a state of “flow.”

This meditative-like state focuses your mind and temporarily pushes aside all your worries.

Hundreds of years ago, Leonardo da Vinci noticed that:

“Painting embraces all the ten functions of the eye; that is to say, darkness, light, body and color, shape and location, distance and closeness, motion and rest.”

Creating art trains you to concentrate on details and pay more attention to your environment.

In this way, it acts like meditation.

A popular art trend for stress relief is adult coloring books."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"This idea was first popularized in France, a country known for its high use of prescription psychiatric drugs, including antidepressants, tranquilizers, and sleeping pills. (2)
Some coloring books are created with stress relief in mind and have become an acceptable adult form of artistic expression.

Many art therapists are supportive of the movement and believed that coloring can act as a gateway to reach more people who could benefit from art therapy. (3)

For instance, this has worked to gently transition military veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) into art therapy. (4)

NEED A MENTAL LIFT?

A quality brain supplement can make a big difference.

See our review of MIND LAB PRO

ART ENCOURAGES CREATIVE THINKING

Dr. Lawrence Katz is an internationally recognized pioneer in neuron regeneration research and author of Keep Your Brain Alive: 83 Neurobic Exercises to Help Prevent Memory Loss and Increase Mental Fitness.

He found that mental decline was due mainly to the loss of communication between brain cells, not from the death of brain cells themselves. (5)

Dr. Katz coined the phrase “neurobics” to describe brain exercises that use your senses in new and novel ways; creating art certainly fits this definition.

Art enhances problem-solving skills. (6)
It encourages creative thinking and lets you come up with your own unique solutions.

Out-of-the-box thinking also stimulates your brain to grow new neurons.

CREATIVE THINKING: A WHOLE-BRAIN ACTIVITY

Contrary to popular belief, creative thinking does not mean using just the right side of your brain.

What it does do, however, is get both hemispheres of your brain communicating with each other. (7)

The concept of left-brain, right-brain dominance never had a strong foundation in science in the first place, and now this theory has been totally debunked.

It also promotes the stereotype that you can’t be both analytical and creative, which is obviously not true.

Some of the greatest minds of all time, including Leonardo da Vinci and Albert Einstein, were simultaneously analytical and creative."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"The most complicated functions that humans perform, such as thinking creatively, learning a language, or playing or listening to music, all require whole-brain thinking. (8, 9)

HOW ART BOOSTS SELF-ESTEEM AND SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT

You may stick your kids’ artwork on the refrigerator door to boost their self-esteem.

Displaying your latest work of art can instill the same feeling in you.

Creating art increases the feel-good neurotransmitter dopamine.

Dopamine has been called the “motivation molecule.”

It boosts drive, focus, and concentration.

It enables you to plan ahead and resist impulses so that you can achieve your goals
It gives you that “I did it!” feeling when you accomplish what you set out to do.

Dopamine stimulates the creation of new neurons and prepares your brain for learning. (10)

"" There is no need to feel intimidated about creating art since it’s the process of creating that provides the benefits, not the quality of the results.
You don’t have to produce fine art to reap the benefits of the creative process.

Crafting hobbies of all kinds — knitting, quilting, sewing, drawing, photography, woodworking, gardening, and do-it-yourself home repair — increase dopamine, ward off depression, and protect the brain from aging. (11)"
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"HOW ART AFFECTS THE BRAIN: INCREASED CONNECTIVITY AND PLASTICITY

Every time you engage in a new or complex activity, your brain creates new connections between brain cells.

Your brain’s ability to grow connections and change throughout your lifetime is called brain plasticity, or neuroplasticity.
Creating art stimulates communication between various parts of the brain.

In this way, creating art has been proven to increase psychological and emotional resilience, making you more resistant to stress. (12)

It’s thought that intelligence depends more on the number of brain connections than the size of your brain. (13)"
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"HOW ART MAKES CHILDREN BETTER STUDENTS FOR LIFE

Educators and parents alike have long suspected that music and arts programs make for overall better students.

Now, with neuroimaging, science can finally back this up.

Children with musical training perform better in math, language, and reading. (14, 15)

Early music lessons enhance brain plasticity and connectivity. (16, 17)

There’s evidence that the brain-enhancing benefits of music lessons received during childhood can follow through into adulthood and last a lifetime. (18)

[Music makes you smarter, happier, and more productive at any age.]
The benefits of visual art programs are equally impressive. Art lessons increase brain plasticity, fluid intelligence, IQ, and attention.

They improve overall behav­ior and reduce impulsiveness. (19)

Unfortunately, educational budget cuts have slashed music and arts programs across the US in recent years.

Considering the lifelong benefits of art training, many educators believe this to be a short-sighted policy."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"VIEWING ART INCREASES EMPATHY, TOLERANCE, AND FEELINGS OF LOVE

A study of over 10,000 students found that a one-hour trip to an art museum changed the way they thought and felt.

Students who visited a museum not only showed improved critical thinking skills, they also exhibited greater empathy regarding how people lived in the past and expressed greater tolerance towards people different than themselves. (20)

Professor Semir Zeki, a neurobiologist at the University College London, discovered that simply the act of viewing art gives pleasure, much like falling in love.

Brain scans revealed that looking at works of art triggers a surge of dopamine in the same area of the brain that registers romantic love. (21)

For most of us, it’s not possible to visit an art museum every day, but you can easily get a daily dose of culture with the Daily Art app.

This free app shares an interesting background story on one painting masterpiece each day.

Art enhances cognitive abilities and memory, even for people with serious brain disorders.

Dementia is mainly thought of as a memory loss problem, but patients also experience other symptoms, such as agitation, aggression, anxiety, depression, and insomnia.

Drug treatment for dementia symptoms is generally not very successful.

When dementia patients are encouraged to create visual art, they derive obvious pleasure from it.
It improves their social behavior and self-esteem, and reduces psychiatric symptoms. (22)"

Millions of people deal with chronic health conditions and the stress, anxiety, and depression that accompany them.

In The Connection Between Art, Healing, and Public Health: A Review of Current Literature, researchers analyzed and reported on the findings of over 100 studies done on the benefits of art on physical and psychological health.

They found that music and visual arts affected patients in these positive ways:

Art let patients forget about their illness for a while, allowing them to focus on positive life experiences.
Creating art enabled them to maintain the identity of who they were before they got sick.
Creative pursuits gave them a sense of achievement.
The creation process helped patients express their feelings.
Art creation reduced stress by lowering levels of the stress hormone cortisol.
Dr. John Graham-Pole is a retired pediatric oncologist who wrote poetry to process some of the grim realities he faced working at a hospital. (23)

,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"For as long as humanity has existed, art has been part of our lives. For many years, people have been creating and enjoying art.  It expresses emotions or expression of life. It is one such creation that enables interpretation of any kind.

It is a skill that applies to music, painting, poetry, dance and more. Moreover, nature is no less than art. For instance, if nature creates something unique, it is also art. Artists use their artwork for passing along their feelings.

Thus, art and artists bring value to society and have been doing so throughout history. Art gives us an innovative way to view the world or society around us. Most important thing is that it lets us interpret it on our own individual experiences and associations.

Art is similar to live which has many definitions and examples. What is constant is that art is not perfect or does not revolve around perfection. It is something that continues growing and developing to express emotions, thoughts and human capacities."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Art comes in many different forms which include audios, visuals and more. Audios comprise songs, music, poems and more whereas visuals include painting, photography, movies and more.

You will notice that we consume a lot of audio art in the form of music, songs and more. It is because they help us to relax our mind. Moreover, it also has the ability to change our mood and brighten it up.

After that, it also motivates us and strengthens our emotions. Poetries are audio arts that help the author express their feelings in writings. We also have music that requires musical instruments to create a piece of art.

Other than that, visual arts help artists communicate with the viewer. It also allows the viewer to interpret the art in their own way. Thus, it invokes a variety of emotions among us. Thus, you see how essential art is for humankind.

Without art, the world would be a dull place. Take the recent pandemic, for example, it was not the sports or news which kept us entertained but the artists. Their work of arts in the form of shows, songs, music and more added meaning to our boring lives.

Therefore, art adds happiness and colours to our lives and save us from the boring monotony of daily life."

,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"One of the first questions raised when talking about art is simple — why should we care? Art, especially in the contemporary era, is easy to dismiss as a selfish pastime for people who have too much time on their hands. Creating art doesn't cure disease, build roads, or feed the poor. So to understand the value of art, let’s look at how art has been valued through history and consider how it is valueable today.
The value of creating
At the most basic level, the act of creating art is in itself rewarding. Children draw for the joy of it before they can speak, and creating pictures, sculptures and writing is both a valuable means of communicating ideas and is simply fun. Creating is instinctive in humans, for the pleasure of exercising creativity. While applied creativity is valueable in a work context, free-form creativity leads to new ideas.
Material value
Through the ages, art has often been created from valuable materials. Gold, ivory and gemstones adorn medieval crowns, and even the paints used by renaissance artists were made from rare materials like lapis lazuli, ground into pigment. These objects may have creative value for their beauty and craftsmanship, but are intrisically valuable because of the materials they contain.
Historical value
Artwork is a record of cultural history. Many ancient cultures have been entirely lost to time, except for the artworks they created, a legacy that helps us understand our human past. Even recent work can help us understand the lives and times of its creators, like the artwork of 1920’s African-American artists during the Harlem Renaissance. Artwork is inextricably tied to the time and cultural context it was created in, a relationship called zeitgeist, making art a window into history.
Religious value
For religions around the world, artwork illustrates their beliefs. Depicting gods and godesses, from Shiva to the Madonna, make the concepts of faith real to the faithfu. Artwork has been believed to contain the spirits of gods or ancestors, or may be designed to create an aura of awe and worship like the Badshahi Mosque.
Patriotic value
Art has long been a source of national pride, both as an example of the skill and dedications of a country’s artisans, and as expressions of the country’s accomplishments and history, like the Arc de Triomphe, which honors the soldiers who died in the Napoleonic Wars with a heroic monument. Of course the patriotic value of art can slide into propaganda as well, used to sway the populace towards a political agenda.
Symbolic value
Art is uniquely suited to communicating ideas. Whether it’s writing or painting or sculpture, artwork can distill complex concepts into symbols that can be understood, in some cases across language barriers and cultures. When art achieves symbolic value it can become a rallying point for a movement, like J. Howard Miller’s 1942 illustration of Rosie the Riveter, which has become an icon of feminism and women’s economic impact across the western world.
Societal value
And here’s where the rubber meets the road: when we look at our world today, we see a seemingly insurmountable wave of fear, bigotry, and hatred expressed by groups of people against anyone who is different than them. While issues of racial and gender bias, homophobia and religious intolerance run deep, and have many complex and subconcious sources, much of the problem lies with a lack of empathy. When you look at another person and don't see them as human, that’s the beginning of fear, violence and war. Art is communication. And in the contemporary world, it’s often a deeply personal communication. When you create art, you share your worldview, your history, your culture and yourself with the world. Art is a window, however small, into the human struggles and stories of all people. So go see art, find art from other cultures, other religions, other orientations and perspectives. If we learn about each other, maybe we can finally see that we're all in this together.
...
Art is a uniquely human expression of creativity. It helps us understand our past, people who are different than us, and ultimately, ourselves."

Art essay as a specific form of exploring certain aesthetic and formal issues appeared with the rise of modernity. Various intellectuals differing in professions started grasping the impact both historical and modern art had on human thought and the society. Some essays were so innovative and radical that they changed to course of the art history, sending it in entirely new directions.

,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists? was written by Linda Nochlin, one of the most important feminist art historians. This particular text appeared in the 1971 edition of ArtNews, which thematized Women’s Liberation, Woman Artists, and Art History. At the time Nochlin was teaching art history at Vassar, and after reading the second-wave feminist publications such as Redstockings Newsletter and Everywoman her work took a different direction. The following year during a Vassar graduation ceremony, Nochlin spoke with an art dealer Richard Feigen, who expressed his desire to represent women artists and asked her a simple question: Why are there no great women artists?, which haunted her and led to the emergence of this essay (and the milestone international exhibition Women Artists: 1550-1950 curated by Nochlin in 1976 in the wake of institutional recognition of the Feminist Art Movement).

After it was published, it almost instantly became an influential text since Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists? was the first major art essay of the field. Nochlin underlined that art history is a male-dominated Western construct by delivering her innovative methodological approach through four chapters (The Question of the Nude, The Lady's Accomplishment, Successes, and Rosa Bonheur); the renowned art historian argues that ""the feminist art historian should pick apart, analyze, and question the social and institutional structures that underpin artistic production, the art world, and art history.""

Essentially, this essay is crucial for understanding the necessity of a feminist intervention based on the rejection of unequal and unjust principles the discipline of art history is formed upon, as well as binary oppositions (men/women, black/white, heterosexual/homosexual, cisgender/transgender).

By proposing two leading concepts such as IT or Imitation Theory and the opposite RT or Reality Theory, the art critic/philosopher went further by attempting to explain the mechanisms of defining art with a special take on the avant-garde movement and the post-impressionist painting.

In particular, the text The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction is cited and explored in regards to the technological paradigm ever changed by the digital.

Namely, this essay was issued in 1935 and it is based on the exploration of the notion of authenticity (original vs. fake) expressed through the aura of a work of art devalued by mechanical reproduction. Looking from the critical Leftist (Marxist) stance, Benjamin argues the development of the artwork under capitalism; mechanical reproduction offers the artist a new way to think and produce artworks in the absence of traditional and ritualistic value and make it a tool for sociopolitical transformation.

The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction greatly influenced the currents in art history, cultural studies, and media theory.

By articulating the apparent copy, Krauss investigates the aesthetic and formal issues imposed by the electrifying relationship between the original and the copy.

Furthermore, Krauss questions modernity while dissecting practices by artists spanning from Rodin to Sherry Levine and Carle Andre. She refers to Benjamin’s aforementioned The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction while rewriting the history of Modernism and reasserting the propositions expressed in earlier texts dealing with the same subject."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Theory of the Avant-Garde is an essential text for understanding avant-garde and was written by German art theorist Peter Bürger in 1974. The author describes the early avant-garde movements as a fierce attack on the institution of art aimed to merge art and life into one. Bürger claims that this avant-garde agenda resulted in with the production of inorganic artworks, and although those artists finally failed in managing their aspirations, the author honors them for making a fundamental change in the development of modern art.

According to Bürger, the institutional function of art in bourgeois society is governed by the principle of autonomy: as it detaches itself from life, it opposes itself to society by surrendering its ability to make a change.

Against Interpretation by Susan Sontag

The last essay on our list is called Against Interpretation and was written by the acclaimed author Susan Sontag, best known for her contribution to understanding photography. Written in 1966, it is part of a collection of essays which also includes On Style.

With this particular text, Sontag proposed the transcendental power of art which was often taken for granted by the critics prone on constructing their intellectual readings. Moreover, she underlined that the modern style of interpretation lost sensitivity due to intent to excavate or destroy a piece of art.

,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"A waste of money?

Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead.

To what extent do you agree with this statement?
Art is considered to be the main core of the country’s civilization and heritage. However, this type of science could attract people all over the world, so the governments have paid much more money on it rather than the significant daily services for the general population. In my point of view, government should cover all essential services financially then they could pay attentions to other entertained arts and theaters. 

There are reasonable factors of why general services have taken the first priority by the government. First of all, Offering the best, high technological services for a normal citizen support him to work efficiently and rapidly. Secondly, once these governments seek to comfort their people by covering all their obvious requirements, the citizen would definitely aim to put his effort and behave to serve this country. Therefore, exchanging the benefits between the citizens and government is the significant advantage from the investing money on general services. 

Some people have claimed that art and theater deserve much money more than general public services for two points. Although art field expresses as type of entertainment, a great deal of people extremely enjoys of being in front of the most popular singer, for instance Celindion, listen to her fascinated songs they love. Eventually, this might be for them one of the main necessity of their lives, especially in the leisure times. 

Whatever was the need for the art and artists, I think the money should go for serving the human needs due to having better world and comfortable environments. I believe that singers and actors can work in places where the general people are fairly have served by governments. Hopefully, no more complaining about this issue anymore; otherwise crimes might be started in these countries. "

,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"The history of art focuses on objects made by humans in visual form for aesthetic purposes. Visual art can be classified in diverse ways, such as separating fine arts from applied arts; inclusively focusing on human creativity; or focusing on different media such as architecture, sculpture, painting, film, photography, and graphic arts. In recent years, technological advances have led to video art, computer art, performance art, animation, television, and videogames.

The history of art is often told as a chronology of masterpieces created during each civilization. It can thus be framed as a story of high culture, epitomized by the Wonders of the World. On the other hand, vernacular art expressions can also be integrated into art historical narratives, referred to as folk arts or craft. The more closely that an art historian engages with these latter forms of low culture, the more likely it is that they will identify their work as examining visual culture or material culture, or as contributing to fields related to art history, such as anthropology or archaeology. In the latter cases, art objects may be referred to as archeological artifacts."

Paleolithic[edit]
Main article: Prehistoric art
See also: List of Stone Age art
The oldest secure human art that has been found dates to the Late Stone Age during the Upper Paleolithic, possibly from around 70,000 BC,[7] but with certainty from around 40,000 BC, when the first creative works were made from shell, stone, and paint by Homo sapiens, using symbolic thought.[11] During the Upper Paleolithic (50,000–10,000 BC), humans practiced hunting and gathering and lived in caves, where cave painting was developed.[12] During the Neolithic period (10,000–3,000 BC) the production of handicrafts commenced.

The appearance of creative capacity within these early societies exemplifies an evolutionarily selective advantage for artistic individuals. Since survival is not contingent on the production of art, art-producing individuals demonstrated agency over their environments in that they had spare time to create once their essential duties, like hunting and gathering, were completed.[13] These preliminary artists were rare and ""highly gifted"" within their communities.[14] They indicated advancements in cognition and understanding of symbolism.[14]

However, the earliest human artifacts showing evidence of workmanship with an artistic purpose are the subject of some debate. It is clear that such workmanship existed by 40,000 years ago in the Upper Paleolithic era, although it is quite possible that it began earlier.

The artistic manifestations of the Upper-Paleolithic reached their peak in the Magdalenian period (±15,000–8,000 BC). This surge in creative outpourings is known as the ""Upper Paleolithic Revolution"" or the ""Creative Explosion"".[15] Surviving art from this period includes small carvings in stone or bone and cave painting. The first traces of human-made objects appeared in southern Africa, the Western Mediterranean, Central and Eastern Europe (Adriatic Sea), Siberia (Baikal Lake), India and Australia. These first traces are generally worked stone (flint, obsidian), wood or bone tools. To paint in red, iron oxide was used. Color, pattern, and visual likeness were components of Paleolithic art. Patterns used included zig-zag, criss cross, and parallel lines.[14]

Cave paintings have been found in the Franco-Cantabrian region. There are pictures that are abstract as well as pictures that are naturalistic. Cave paintings were symbolically representative of activities that required learned participants – they were used as teaching tools and showcase an increased need for communication and specialized skills for early humans.[16] Animals were painted in the caves of Altamira, Trois Frères, Chauvet and Lascaux. Sculpture is represented by the so-called Venus figurines, feminine figures which may have been used in fertility cults, such as the Venus of Willendorf.[17] There is a theory that these figures may have been made by women as expressions of their own body.[18] Other representative works of this period are the Man from Brno,[19] and Venus of Brassempouy.[20]

A function of Paleolithic art was magical, being used in rituals. Paleolithic artists were particular people, respected in the community because their artworks were linked with religious beliefs. In this way, artifacts were symbols of certain deities or spirits."

In Old World archaeology, Mesolithic (Greek: μέσος, mesos ""middle""; λίθος, lithos ""stone"") is the period between the Upper Paleolithic and the Neolithic. The term Epipaleolithic is often used synonymously, especially for outside northern Europe, and for the corresponding period in the Levant and Caucasus. The Mesolithic has different time spans in different parts of Eurasia. It refers to the final period of hunter-gatherer cultures in Europe and West Asia, between the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and the Neolithic Revolution. In Europe it spans roughly 15,000 to 5,000 BC, in Southwest Asia (the Epipalaeolithic Near East) roughly 20,000 to 8,000 BC. The term is less used of areas further east, and not at all beyond Eurasia and North Africa.

Neolithic[edit]
Main article: Neolithic
The Neolithic period began about 10,000 BC. The rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin—dated between the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras—contained small, schematic paintings of human figures, with notable examples in El Cogul, Valltorta, Alpera and Minateda.

Neolithic painting is similar to paintings found in northern Africa (Atlas, Sahara) and in the area of modern Zimbabwe. Neolithic painting is often schematic, made with basic strokes (men in the form of a cross and women in a triangular shape). There are also cave paintings in Pinturas River in Argentina, especially the Cueva de las Manos. In portable art, a style called Cardium pottery was produced, decorated with imprints of seashells. New materials were used in art, such as amber, crystal, and jasper. In this period, the first traces of urban planning appeared, such as the remains in Tell as-Sultan (Jericho), Jarmo (Iraq) and Çatalhöyük (Anatolia).[23] In South-Eastern Europe appeared many cultures, such as the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture (from Romania, Republic of Moldova and Ukraine), and the Hamangia culture (from Romania and Bulgaria). Other regions with many cultures are China, most notable being the Yangshao culture and the Longshan culture; and Egypt, with the Badarian, the Naqada I, II and III cultures.

Common materials of Neolithic sculptures from Anatolia, are ivory, stone, clay and bone. Many are anthropomorphic, especially female, zoomorphic ones being rare. Female figurines are both fat and slender. Both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic carvings have been discovered in Siberia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and China.[24]"

In the first period of recorded history, art coincided with writing. The great civilizations of the Near East: Egypt and Mesopotamia arose. Globally, during this period the first great cities appeared near major rivers: the Nile, Tigris and Euphrates, Indus and Yellow River.

One of the great advances of this period was writing, which was developed from the tradition of communication using pictures. The first form of writing were the Jiahu symbols from Neolithic China, but the first true writing was cuneiform script, which emerged in Mesopotamia c. 3500 BC, written on clay tablets. It was based on pictographic and ideographic elements, while later Sumerians developed syllables for writing, reflecting the phonology and syntax of the Sumerian language. In Egypt hieroglyphic writing was developed using pictures as well, appearing on art such as the Narmer Palette (3,100 BC). The Indus Valley Civilization sculpted seals with short texts and decorated with representations of animals and people. Meanwhile, the Olmecs sculpted colossal heads and decorated other sculptures with their own hieroglyphs. In these times, writing was accessible only for the elites."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,," Mesopotamian art
Mesopotamian art was developed in the area between Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in modern-day Syria and Iraq, where since the 4th millennium BC many different cultures existed such as Sumer, Akkad, Amorite and Chaldea. Mesopotamian architecture was characterized by the use of bricks, lintels, and cone mosaic. Notable examples are the ziggurats, large temples in the form of step pyramids. The tomb was a chamber covered with a false dome, as in some examples found at Ur. There were also palaces walled with a terrace in the form of a ziggurat, where gardens were an important feature. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

Relief sculpture was developed in wood and stone. Sculpture depicted religious, military, and hunting scenes, including both human and animal figures. In the Sumerian period, small statues of people were produced. These statues had an angular form and were produced from colored stone. The figures typically had bald head with hands folded on the chest. In the Akkadian period, statues depicted figures with long hair and beards, such as the stele of Naram-Sin. In the Amorite period (or Neosumerian), statues represented kings from Gudea of Lagash, with their mantles and a turbans on their heads, and their hands on their chests. During Babylonian rule, the stele of Hammurabi was important, as it depicted the great king Hammurabi above a written copy of the laws that he introduced. Assyrian sculpture is notable for its anthropomorphism of cattle and the winged genie, which is depicted flying in many reliefs depicting war and hunting scenes, such as in the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,," Ancient Egyptian art
One of the first great civilizations arose in Egypt, which had elaborate and complex works of art produced by professional artists and craftspeople. Egypt's art was religious and symbolic. Given that the culture had a highly centralized power structure and hierarchy, a great deal of art was created to honour the pharaoh, including great monuments. Egyptian art and culture emphasized the religious concept of immortality. Later Egyptian art includes Coptic and Byzantine art.

The architecture is characterized by monumental structures, built with large stone blocks, lintels, and solid columns. Funerary monuments included mastaba, tombs of rectangular form; pyramids, which included step pyramids (Saqqarah) or smooth-sided pyramids (Giza); and the hypogeum, underground tombs (Valley of the Kings). Other great buildings were the temple, which tended to be monumental complexes preceded by an avenue of sphinxes and obelisks. Temples used pylons and trapezoid walls with hypaethros and hypostyle halls and shrines. The temples of Karnak, Luxor, Philae and Edfu are good examples. Another type of temple is the rock temple, in the form of a hypogeum, found in Abu Simbel and Deir el-Bahari.

Painting of the Egyptian era used a juxtaposition of overlapping planes. The images were represented hierarchically, i.e., the Pharaoh is larger than the common subjects or enemies depicted at his side. Egyptians painted the outline of the head and limbs in profile, while the torso, hands, and eyes were painted from the front. Applied arts were developed in Egypt, in particular woodwork and metalwork. There are superb examples such as cedar furniture inlaid with ebony and ivory which can be seen in the tombs at the Egyptian Museum. Other examples include the pieces found in Tutankhamun's tomb, which are of great artistic value."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Discovered long after the contemporary civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization or Harappan civilization (c. 2400–1900 BC) is now recognized as extraordinally advanced, comparable in many ways with those cultures.

Various sculptures, seals, bronze vessels pottery, gold jewellery, and anatomically detailed figurines in terracotta, bronze, and steatite have been found at excavation sites.[30]

A number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some dance form. These terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultic significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the civilisation are religious symbols.[31]

Realistic statuettes have been found in the site in the Indus Valley Civilization. One of them is the famous bronze statuette of a slender-limbed Dancing Girl adorned with bangles, found in Mohenjo-daro. Two other realistic statuettes have been found in Harappa in proper stratified excavations, which display near-Classical treatment of the human shape: the statuette of a dancer who seems to be male, and a red jasper male torso, both now in the Delhi National Museum. Archaeologist Sir John Marshall reacted with surprise when he saw these two statuettes from Harappa:[32]

When I first saw them I found it difficult to believe that they were prehistoric; they seemed to completely upset all established ideas about early art, and culture. Modeling such as this was unknown in the ancient world up to the Hellenistic age of Greece, and I thought, therefore, that some mistake must surely have been made; that these figures had found their way into levels some 3000 years older than those to which they properly belonged ... Now, in these statuettes, it is just this anatomical truth which is so startling; that makes us wonder whether, in this all-important matter, Greek artistry could possibly have been anticipated by the sculptors of a far-off age on the banks of the Indus.[32]
These statuettes remain controversial, due to their advanced techniques. Regarding the red jasper torso, the discoverer, Vats, claims a Harappan date, but Marshall considered this statuette is probably historical, dating to the Gupta period, comparing it to the much later Lohanipur torso.[33] A second rather similar grey stone statuette of a dancing male was also found about 150 meters away in a secure Mature Harappan stratum. Overall, anthropologist Gregory Possehl tends to consider that these statuettes probably form the pinnacle of Indus art during the Mature Harappan period.[34]

Seals have been found at Mohenjo-daro depicting a figure standing on its head, and another sitting cross-legged in what some call a yoga-like pose such as the so-called Pashupati. This figure has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva.[35] If this can be validated, it would be evidence that some aspects of Hinduism predate the earliest texts, the Veda."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Chinese art Bronze casting, Chinese ritual bronzes, and Sanxingdui
Further information: Shang dynasty and Zhou dynasty
During the Chinese Bronze Age (the Shang and Zhou dynasties) court intercessions and communication with the spirit world were conducted by a shaman (possibly the king himself). In the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1050 BC), the supreme deity was Shangdi, but aristocratic families preferred to contact the spirits of their ancestors. They prepared elaborate banquets of food and drink for them, heated and served in bronze ritual vessels. Bronze vessels were used in religious rituals to cement Dhang authority, and when the Shang capital fell, around 1050 BC, its conquerors, the Zhou (c. 1050–156 BC), continued to use these containers in religious rituals, but principally for food rather than drink. The Shang court had been accused of excessive drunkenness, and the Zhou, promoting the imperial Tian (""Heaven"") as the prime spiritual force, rather than ancestors, limited wine in religious rites, in favour of food. The use of ritual bronzes continued into the early Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD).

One of the most commonly used motifs was the taotie, a stylized face divided centrally into 2 almost mirror-image halves, with nostrils, eyes, eyebrows, jaws, cheeks and horns, surrounded by incised patterns. Whether taotie represented real, mythological or wholly imaginary creatures cannot be determined.

The enigmatic bronzes of Sanxingdui, near Guanghan (in Sichuan province), are evidence for a mysterious sacrificial religious system unlike anything elsewhere in ancient China and quite different from the art of the contemporaneous Shang at Anyang. Excavations at Sanxingdui since 1986 have revealed 4 pits containing artefacts of bronze, jade and gold. There was found a great bronze statue of a human figure which stands on a plinth decorated with abstract elephant heads. Besides the standing figure, the first 2 pits contained over 50 bronze heads, some wearing headgear and 3 with a frontal covering of gold leaf."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,," Ancient Greek art
Even in antiquity, the arts of Greece were recognised by other cultures as pre-eminent. The Latin poet Horace, writing in the age of Roman emperor Augustus (1st century BC to 1st century AD), famously remarked that although conquered on the battlefield, ""captive Greece overcame its savage conqueror and brought the arts to rustic Rome."" The power of Greek art lies in its representation of the human figure and its focus on human beings and the anthropomorphic gods as chief subjects. During the Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), realism and idealism were delicately balanced. In comparison, work of the earlier Geometric (9th to 8th centuries BC) and Archaic (7th to 6th centuries BC) ages sometimes appears primitive, but these artists had different goals: naturalistic representation was not necessarily their aim. Roman art lover collected ancient Greek originals, Roman replicas of Greek art, or newly created paintings and sculptures fashioned in a variety of Greek styles, thus preserving for posterity works of art otherwise lost. Wall and panel paintings, sculptures and mosaics decorated public spaces and well-to-do private homes. Greek imagery also appeared on Roman jewellery, vessels of gold, silver, bronze and terracotta, and even on weapons and commercial weights. Since the Renaissance, the arts of ancient Greece, transmitted through the Roman Empire, have served as the foundation of Western art."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"After the collapse of Mycenaean society, a style of Greek art emerged that illustrates clearly the break in culture and art between the Bronze Age and the ensuing Iron Age. The Protogeometric (c. 1050–900 BC) and succeeding Geometric (c. 900–700 BC) styles are characterised by their stark simplicity of decoration, as older floral and marine motifs were replaced with abstract patterns. In the new styles, pattern was rigorously applied to shape, each decorative element subordinate to but enhancing the whole. Surfaces were adorned with triangles, lines and semicircles, and concentric circles made with a multiple brush attached to a compass. The meander (Greek key) pattern was popular, as were chequerboards, diamonds, chevrons and stars. Geometric figures, whether painted or sculpted, conform to an abstract aesthetic. Although they have recognisable forms, people and animals are composed of a combination of circles, triangles and rectangles, rather than organic, realistic shapes."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Roman art is sometimes viewed as derived from Greek precedents, but also has its own distinguishing features. Roman sculpture is often less idealized than the Greek precedents, being very realistic. Roman architecture often used concrete, and features such as the round arch and dome were invented. Luxury objects in metal-work, gem engraving, ivory carvings, and glass are sometimes considered in modern terms to be minor forms of Roman art,[56] although this would not necessarily have been the case for contemporaries.

Roman artwork was influenced by the nation-state's interaction with other people's, such as ancient Judea. A major monument is the Arch of Titus, which was erected by the Emperor Titus. Scenes of Romans looting the Jewish temple in Jerusalem are depicted in low-relief sculptures around the arch's perimeter.

Ancient Roman pottery was not a luxury product, but a vast production of ""fine wares"" in terra sigillata were decorated with reliefs that reflected the latest taste, and provided a large group in society with stylish objects at what was evidently an affordable price. Roman coins were an important means of propaganda, and have survived in enormous numbers."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"The olmecs were the earliest known major civilization in Mesoamerica following a progressive development in Soconusco. Olmec is the first to be elaborate as a pre-Columbian civilization of Mesoamerica (c. 1200–400 BC) and one that is thought to have set many of the fundamental patterns evinced by later American Indian cultures of Mexico and Central America, notably the Maya and the Aztec.

They lived in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, in the present-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco. It has been speculated that the Olmecs derive in part from neighboring Mokaya or Mixe–Zoque. The Olmecs flourished during Mesoamerica's formative period, dating roughly from as early as 1500 BC to about 400 BC. Pre-Olmec cultures had flourished in the area since about 2500 BC, but by 1600–1500 BC, early Olmec culture had emerged, centered on the San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán site near the coast in southeast Veracruz.[57] They were the first Mesoamerican civilization, and laid many of the foundations for the civilizations that followed.

The Olmec culture was first defined as an art style, and this continues to be the hallmark of the culture.[58] Wrought in a large number of media – jade, clay, basalt, and greenstone among others – much Olmec art, such as The Wrestler, is naturalistic. Other art expresses fantastic anthropomorphic creatures, often highly stylized, using an iconography reflective of a religious meaning.[59] Common motifs include downturned mouths and a cleft head, both of which are seen in representations of were-jaguars."

In addition to woodwork, two dimensional painting and silver, gold and copper engraved jewelry became important after contact with Europeans.

The Eastern Woodlands, or simply woodlands, cultures inhabited the regions of North America east of the Mississippi River at least since 2500 BC.

,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"The architectural history of Russia is conditioned by Orthodox Eastern Europe: unlike the West, yet similarly, if tenuously, linked with the traditions of classical antiquity (through Byzantium). It has experienced from time to time westernising movements that culminated in the comprehensive reforms of Peter the Great (around 1700). From prehistoric times the material of vernacular Russian architecture was wood. Byzantine churches and the architecture of Kievan Rus were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles. Russian architecture used the dome shape not only for churches but also for other buildings. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers.

The use and making of icons entered Kievan Rus' following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in 988 CE. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians—notably Andrei Rublev and Dionisius—widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when Simon Ushakov's painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe."

The Birth of Venus; by Sandro Botticelli; 1484–1485; tempera on panel; height: 172.5 cm, length: 278.5 cm; Uffizi Gallery (Florence, Italy)
Starting in the 13th century, Italy began to experience a period of great artistic flowering. It is difficult, if not futile, to identify a single impetus for the changes that took place, but a number of factors contributed: a new awareness of antiquity and its distinctiveness, economic prosperity and a coincident sense of competition among patrons and artists, and a newfound awareness of the natural and secular world.

Medieval Europeans didn't perceive a fundamental difference between their own time and antiquity. People were largely indifferent to the scattered vestiges of the past around them, for ancient monuments were familiar to the point of being invisible. Some of these were seen as 'marvels' because of their size or fine carving, but that only made them suspect. The Pantheon in Rome, for example, was said to have been built by demons, and it only survived because it was converted into a church.

The renewed attention to the past as distinct from the present and, more importantly, a desire to revive it, occurred in a series of waves. In the 13th century the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II (reign 1220–1250), who ruled southern Italy, sought to revive the glories of imperial Rome, including its arts. The sculptor Nicola Pisano learned his craft in that environment before moving north to Tuscany and inspiring local sculptors. In the 14th century the Italian poet Petrarch (1304–1374) postulated a definitive break between the golden age of antiquity and his own time of cultural decline. In the 15th century Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472), in his treatise On Painting, wrote of the talented artists of antiquity, in comparison to whom living painters and sculptors were 'in no way inferior'. This sense of distance inspired Italians to view the Roman past with fresh eyes, to learn from the accomplishments of the ancients. Competition was also a crucial motivator, as cities, rulers and private individuals strove to outdo one another in their patronage of public and private artworks."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Baroque appeared at the end of the Renaissance (the 16th century), as a reaction to Classical canons in the next two centuries, the 17th and the 18th. The 17th century was a period of volatile change. Astronomical breakthroughs and scientific inventions such as the telescope and microscope were matched by developments in geography, exploration, natural history and philosophy. Religious upheaval added to the mix, as the Catholic Counter-Reformation contested the growing popularity of Protestant faith. During the Renaissance and Baroque eras, the highest goal of painting was to provide moral exemplars by depicting instructive events from literature, history and mythology. These works are known as history paintings. 17th century history painters were preoccupied with rendering emotion at the most significant moment of a story. This process involved the use of gesture and facial expressions to convey the 'passion of the soul'. This was often combined with a concern for narrative clarity and dramatic concentration, especially in the case of Nicolas Poussin. By such means painters intensified the dramatic impact of narrative scenes, as in Poussin's Abduction of the Sabine Women, in which the horror and fear displayed by the women in contrasted with the aggression and determination of the men, resulting in images of power and terrible beauty.[92]

In decorative and applied arts, Baroque appeared first in the area of present-day Italy, and spread in all Europe. It was a highly ornate and often extravagant style of architecture, music, dance, painting, sculpture and other arts.[93] Main decorative motives include: horns of plenty, festoons, baby angels, lion heads holding a metal ring in their mouths, female faces surrounded by garlands, cartouches, acanthus leaves, classical columns, pediments and other elements of Classical architecture sculpted on some parts of pieces of furniture."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Delicacy, gaiety, youthfulness and sensuality were the ideals of French Rococo painting. Frivolity was a virtue, and portrait painting was increasingly in demand in a society in which a charming likeness was an essential part of seduction. Primarily a style of surface ornament, the Rococo relegated sculpture and painting to secondary roles and used gilding to compartmentalise walls, mirrors and ornamental panels. This style spread quickly throughout Europe and as far as Ottoman Turkey and China, thanks to ornament books featuring cartouches (curvilinear, often asymmetrical, panels), arabesques (sinuous, interlacing plant-like forms) and shell work, as well as designs for wall panels and fireplaces.[97] French Rococo developed during the Régence (1715-1723), when Louis XV (reign between 1715 and 1774) was a child and the country was governed by Philippe d'Orléans. It grew out of the heavier Baroque style of the court of Louis XIV, incorporating lighter elements, more delicate curves, asymmetry and playfulness.[98] In decorative arts and architecture, it can be recognised by its huge quantity of curves and C-shaped volutes, lightness in colour and weight, or low relief work of ribbons, scrolls, shells, flower wreaths, birds and animals.[99] In France, it enters through the style known as Louis Quinze, here being also known as Pompadour. Unlike Baroque, Rococo abandoned symmetry.[100] This style is seen first in decorative arts and design, but by its height around 1730 it had spread to painting and sculpture. Pan and Venus replaced Apollo and Hercules in a rebirth of gods, goddesses and heroes, and in contrast to the sometimes brooding darkness associated with the Baroque style, a light palette was empolyed. Three French painters with whom the term Rococo is most often associated are François Boucher, Jean-Antoine Watteau and Jean-Honoré Fragonard.[98]

The term ""rococo"" comes from the French rocaille, which means ""pebble"", referring to the organic images that decorate walls and panels, some interiors having a cave-like aspect, like an oval salon in the Hôtel de Soubise from Paris.[101]

The interior of the Hôtel de Soubise in Paris are among the most characteristically elegant and refined examples of the Rococo decorative style. The house is one of the most beautiful 18th-century city mansions in Paris. It was built for the Prince and Princess of Soubise in 1375 and remodelled in 1704 under the instructions of François de Rohan, Prince de Soubise. The building, which is divided into two apartments – that of the Prince on the ground floor and that of the Princess on the upper floor, or piano nobile – features on both floors oval salons that overlook the garden. the salons were created between 1735 and 1739 by Germain Boffrand, a pupil of the French architect François Mansart. Boffrand softened the lines of the Salon Oval de la Princesse with sinuous curves, multiplying the mirror reflection. The walls melt into the vaults, and irregular niches for sculpture are separated by rocaille shells. Architecture, sculpture and painting combine to create a rich and harmonious atmosphere. Eight ceiling canvases painted by Charles-Joseph Natoire between 1737 and 1739 illustrate the story of Cupid and Psyche. Before his return from Italy in 1730, Natoire had spent several years in Rome at the Académie de France, where he had studied the works of Paolo Veronese, Antonio Correggio and, especially, Pietro da Cortona, a 17th-century painter of decorative frescos. Their influence is evident in the supple and elegant compositions, the lighting effects, and the way the figures are adapted to the constraints of the decor. The palette of pinks, blues and greens creates a charming arcadian effect, encapsulating the mature Rococo.[96]

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to trade directly with the nations of East Asia, shortly after finding a direct route around Africa in 1498. Britain and Holland followed suit just over a century later with the foundation of their East India companies – Protestant challenges to Portugal's power and Chinese porcelains, Indian textiles and Japanese lacquers flooded the markets of Amsterdam and London. These items were sought after as objects of prestige, symbolic not only for personal wealth but also of the influence of the nations able to import them. European imaginations were fuelled by perceptions of Asia as a place of wealth and luxury, and consequently patrons from emperors to merchants vied with each other in adorning their living quarters with Asian goods and decorating them in Asian styles. Where Asian objects were hard to obtain, European craftsmen and painters stepped up to fill the breach, creating a blend of Rococo forms and authentic Asian figures, motifs and techniques. The vogue for Chinoiserie was ubiquitous: Asian-inspired interiors swept over Europe from Sweden to Sicily and flourished in the Americas from New England to New Spain (Mexico), Brazil to Argentina."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"The revival of Classical styles in the second half of the 18th century was in some ways a reaction against the perceived frivolity and decadence of the Rococo. It was stimulated by the rediscovery of the ancient sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum, which inspired a fascination with Greek and Roman antiquity and influenced all the arts, from painting and sculpture to architecture, fashion, literature and music.

The most original phase of Neoclassicism can be associated with the French Revolution of 1789–1799, when artists and architects drew overt comparisons between their desire for Liberté, Egalité et Fratenité and what they understood to be the political principles of Classical Rome and Greece.[104] The Empire style is representative of the new French society emerging from the revolution that set the tone in all areas of life, including art. This style has introduced the concept of industrial production in decorative art. Other Neoclassical styles include: Adam (English) and the Federal (American). Motifs widely used in Neoclassical applied art are: pediments, acanthus leaves, palmettes, festoons, cartouches, ancient trophies and musical instruments, griffins, chimeras, sphinxes, horns of abundance, lion heads holding a metal ring in their mouths and sometimes winged women.[105] Most of them are taken from Greek, Etruscan or Roman objects, interiors and architecture; but some of them, like the cartouche are from the Renaissance."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Many art historians place the origins of modern art in the late 18th century, others in the mid 19th century. Art historian H. Harvard Arnason stated ""a gradual metamorphosis took place in the course of a hundred years.""[106] Events such as the age of enlightenment, revolutions and democracies in America and France, and the Industrial Revolution had far reaching affects in western culture. People, commodities, ideas, and information could travel between countries and continents with unprecedented speed and these changes were reflected in the arts. The invention of photography in the 1830s further altered certain aspects of art, particularly painting. By the dawn of the 19th century, a long and gradual paradigm shift was complete, from the Gothic when artists were viewed as craftsmen in the service of the church and monarchies, to the idea of art for art's sake, where the ideas and visions of the individual artist were held in the high regard, with patronage from an increasingly literate, affluent, and urban middle and upper class population that had been emerging for 200 years (particularly in Paris and London). A dichotomy begin in the late 18th century between neoclassicism and romanticism that subdivided and continued to run through virtually every new movement in modern art: ""Spreading like waves, these ""isms"" defy national, ethnic, and chronological boundaries; never dominant anywhere for long, they compete or merge with each other in endlessly shifting patterns.""[107]

Modern art has consistently moved toward international influences and exchanges, from the exotic curiosity of Orientalism, the deeper influence of Japonisme, to the arts of Oceania, Africa, and the Americas. Conversely modern art has increasingly extended beyond western Europe. In Russia and the USA the arts were developing to a degree that rivaled the leading European countries by the end of the 19th century. Many of the major movements appeared in Latin America, Australia, and Asia too and geography and nationality became increasingly insignificant with each passing decade. By the 20th century important and influential artist were emerging around the world: e.g. Foujita (Japan), Arshile Gorky (Armenia), Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo (Mexico), Wifredo Lam (Cuba), Edvard Munch (Norwegian), Roberto Matta (Chilean), Mark Rothko (Lithuanian-American), Fernando Botero Angulo (Colombia), Constantin Brâncuși and Victor Brauner (Romania)"
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Romanticism emerged in the late 18th century and flourished in the first half of the 19th century with significant and international manifestations in music, literature, poetry, and architecture, as well as the visual arts. One of the earliest expressions of romanticism was in the English landscape garden, carefully designed to appear natural and standing in dramatic contrast to the formal gardens of the time. The concept of the ""natural"" English garden was adopted throughout Europe and America in the following decades. In architecture, the romantics frequently turned to alternative sources other than the Greek and Roman examples admired by the neo-classicist. Romantic architecture often revived Gothic forms and other styles such as exotic eastern models. The Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament), London is an example of romantic architecture that is also referred to as Gothic Revival.[112] In painting romanticism is exemplified by the paintings of Francisco Goya in Spain, Eugène Delacroix and Théodore Géricault in France, William Blake, Henry Fuseli, Samuel Palmer, and William Turner in England, Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge in Germany, Francesco Hayez in Italy, Johan Christian Claussen Dahl in Norway, and Thomas Cole in America. Examples of sculptors of the romantic period include Antoine-Louis Barye, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Auguste Préault, and François Rude. As romanticism ran its course, some aspects of the movement evolved into symbolism.[110][113][114]

""Neoclassicism is a new revival of classical antiquity.....while Romanticism refers not to a specific style but to an attitude of mind that may reveal itself in any number of ways.""[112] Romanticism often attempts to address the viewer through the heart and psyche, evoking passions and emotions, often reflecting on mankind's relationship and place in nature in the industrial revolution; in contrast to the symmetry, rational, ""cult of reason""[115] of Neoclassicism."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Realism emerged in the mid-nineteenth century, c. 1840, and had counterparts in sculpture, literature, and drama, often referred to as Naturalism in literature. In nineteenth-century painting, the term Realism refers more to the subject matter depicted than to the style or technique. Realist paintings typically represent ordinary places and people engaged in everyday activities, as opposed to grand, idealized landscapes, mythological gods, biblical subjects, and historical figures and events that had often dominated painting in western culture. Courbet said ""I cannot paint an angel because I have never seen one"".[112] Realism was also in part a reaction to the often dramatic, exotic, and emotionally charged work of romanticism. The term realism is applied relative to the idealized imagery of neo-classicism and the romanticized imagery of romanticism. Artists such as Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Honoré Daumier had loose associations with realism, as did members of the Barbizon School, particularly Jean-François Millet, but it was perhaps Gustave Courbet who was the central figure in the movement, self identifying as a realist, advocating realism, and influencing younger artists such as Édouard Manet. One significant aspect of realism was the practice of painting landscapes en plein air and its subsequent influence on impressionism. Beyond France, realism is exemplified by artists such as Wilhelm Leibl in Germany, Ford Madox Brown in England, and Winslow Homer in the United States. Art historian H. H. Arnason wrote, ""The chronological sequence of neo-classicism, romanticism, and realism is, of course, only a convenient stratification of movements or tendencies so inextricably bound up with one another and with the preceding movements that it is impossible to tell where one ended and another began"",[116] and this becomes even more pertinent and complex as one follows all of the movements and ""isms"" into the late 19th and early 20th centuries."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Impressionism emerged in France, under the influences of Realism, the Barbizon School, and en plein air painters like Eugène Boudin, Camille Corot, Charles- Francois Daubigny, and Johan Barthold Jongkind. Starting in the late 1850s, several of the impressionists had made acquaintances and friendships as students in Paris, notably at the free Académie Suisse and Charles Gleyre's studio. Their progressive work was frequently rejected by the conservative juries of the prestigious Académie des Beaux Arts salons, a forum where many artist turned to establish their reputations, and many of the young artist were included in a highly publicized, but much ridiculed Salon des Refusés in 1863. In 1874 they formed the Société Anonyme Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs, independent of the academy, and mounted the first of several impressionist exhibitions in Paris, through to 1886 when their eighth and final exhibition was held. Important figures in the movement included Frédéric Bazille, Gustave Caillebotte, Mary Cassatt, Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Armand Guillaumin, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley. Although impressionism was primarily a movement of painters, Degas and Renoir also produced sculptures and others like Auguste Rodin and Medardo Rosso are sometimes linked to impressionism. By 1885 impressionism had achieved some prominence, and yet a younger generation were already pushing the limits beyond impressionism. Artist from Russia, Australia, America and Latin America soon adopted impressionist styles. A few of the original impressionist continued producing significant work into the 1910s and 1920s.[118][121][122]

Although not unprecedented, many of the techniques used were in contrast to traditional methods. Paintings were often completed in hours or days with wet paint applied to wet paint (opposed to wet on dry paint, completed in weeks and months). Rather than applying glazes and mixed colors, pure colors were often applied side by side, in thick, opaque, impasto strokes; blending in the eye of the viewer when observed from a distance. Black was used very sparingly, or not at all, and defining lines replaced with nuanced strokes of color forming the subjects, contours, and shapes. Art historian H. W. Janson said ""instead of adding to the illusion of real space, it strengthens the unity of the actual painted surface.""[112] Impressionist paintings typically depict landscapes, portraits, still lifes, domestic scenes, daily leisure and nightlife, all treated in a realist manner. Compositions were often based on unusual perspectives, appearing spontaneous and candid. The paintings were usually void of didactic, symbolic, or metaphoric meanings, and rarely addressed the biblical, mythological, and historical subjects that were so highly regarded by the academies or the darker and psychological interest explored by the symbolist. The nuances of light, shadow, atmosphere, and reflections of colors from surfaces were examined, sometimes emphasizing changes of these elements in time. The painting itself was the subject of the painting. It was art for art's sake, an idea that had been floating around for a few of decades but it perhaps reached a new high and consistency in impressionism."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Symbolism emerged in France and Belgium in the 3rd quarter of the nineteenth century and spread throughout Europe in the 1870s, and later to America to a lesser extent. It evolved from romanticism without a clear or defining demarcation point, although poetry, literature, and specifically the publication of Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil) in 1857 were significant in the development of symbolism. It had international expression in poetry, literature, drama, and music. In architecture, the applied arts, and decorative arts symbolism closely paralleled and overlapped into Art Nouveau. Symbolism is often inextricably linked to other contemporary art movements, surfacing and finding expression within other styles like Post-Impressionism, Les Nabis, the Decadent Movement, the Fin-de Siecle, Art Nouveau, The Munich Secession, The Vienna Secession, Expressionism, and even the Pre-Raphaelites, which had formed before and influenced symbolism as well. Artist as diverse as James McNeill Whistler, Eugène Carrière, Ferdinand Hodler, Fernand Khnopff, Giovanni Segantini, Lucien Lévy-Dhurmer, Jean Delville, and James Ensor all had varying degrees of association with symbolism. Art historian Robert L. Delevoy wrote ""Symbolism was less a school than the atmosphere of a period.""[125] It quickly began to fade with the onset of Fauvism, Cubism, Futurism and had largely dissipated by the outbreak of the First World War, however it did find some sustained development and relevance in the metaphysical school, which in turn had a profound influence on surrealism.[125][123][126]

The subjects, themes, and meanings of symbolist art are frequently veiled and obscure, but at its best still manage to resonate deeply on psychological or emotional levels. The subjects are often presented as metaphors or allegories, aiming to evoke highly subjective, personal, introspective emotions and ideas in the viewer, without clearly defining or addressing the subject directly. The poet Stéphane Mallarmé wrote ""depict not the thing but the effect it produces""[127] and ""To name an object is to suppress three quarters of the pleasure of the poem which is made to be understood little by little"".[126] The English painter George Frederic Watts stated ""I paint ideas, not things."""
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"The Arts and Crafts movement mostly worked in architecture and the decorative arts, where it promoted traditional craftsmanship, the use of locally available materials, and integrity in the way in which things were made. It began in the late-19th century Britain, when writers such as John Ruskin and William Morris rejected mass-production and the often poor quality, machine-made items that were found in many homes and shops. Morris, in particular, believed in the importance of the individual craftsman, and advocated a return to hand craftsman, which, he argued, would not only produce better furniture, pottery, textiles, and other items, but would also help people to lead better, more fulfilling lives. Mass-production, he maintained, was responsible for a decline in values. Many Arts and Crafts designers drew upon the influence of medieval craftsmanship, and their objects and interiors exploited the distinctive qualities of natural materials, from beautifully finished oak to hand-woven tapestries. Others, however, looked further afield for inspiration, incorporating vivid colours inspired by Islamic art, or ancient Egyptian motifs in their work. Knots, swirls, Celtic crosses, and entrelac (interlanced designs) inspired by ancient Celtic art featured in the work of many Arts and Craftsdesigners, notably Archibald Knox, especially on metalwork.

Widely exhibited in Europe, the Arts and Crafts style's simplicity inspired artists such as Carl Larsson and wife, Karin Bergöö Larsson, designers like Henry van de Velde and styles such as Art Nouveau, the Dutch De Stijl group, Vienna Secession, and eventually the Bauhaus style. Nikolaus Pevsner regarded the style as a prelude to Modernism, which used simple forms without ornamentation.[128] The Vienna Secession encouraged in part Central European artists and writers under Habsburg rule to return to their national and folk roots. In Poland this gave rise to the flowering of ""Młoda Polska"" (Young Poland), whose noted exponents included Jacek Malczewski, Jan Stanisławski, Józef Mehoffer, Józef Pankiewicz, Leon Wyczółkowski, Olga Boznańska, Stanisław Wyspiański, Wojciech Gerson and Wojciech Kossak.[129]"
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Post-Impressionism is a rather imprecise term applied to a diverse generation of artists. In its strictest sense, it pertains to four highly influential artists: Paul Cézanne,[130][131] Paul Gauguin,[132][133] Georges Seurat,[134][135] and Vincent van Gogh.[136][137] Each passed through an impressionist phase, but ultimately emerged with four very original but different styles. Collectively, their work anticipated, and often directly influenced, much of the avant-garde art that appear before the First World War including fauvism, cubism, expressionism, and early abstraction. Cézanne (particularly influential on cubism) and Van Gogh worked in relative isolation, away from Paris, at critical points in their careers, while Seurat and Gauguin worked in groups, more collaboratively, at key points in their development. Another important artist of the period is Toulouse-Lautrec, an influential painter as well as graphic artist.[138][139] In a broader sense, post-impressionism includes a generation of predominantly French and Belgian artist who worked in a range of styles and groups. Most had come under the sway of impressionism at some point, but pushed their work beyond it into a number of factions as early as the mid 1880s, sometimes as a logical development of impressionism, other times as a reaction against it. Post-Impressionists typically depicted impressionist subjects, but the work, particularly synthetism, often contained symbolism, spiritualism, and moody atmospheres that rarely appeared in impressionism. Unnatural colors, patterns, flat plains, odd perspectives and viewpoints pushed to extremes, all moved the center of modernism a step closer to abstraction with a standard for experimentation."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Neo-Impressionism (Divisionism or Pointillism, c. 1884–1894) explored light and color based on scientific color theories, creating mosaics of brush strokes in pure colors, sometimes laid out in rhythmic patterns with lines influenced by Art Nouveau. The leading artists were Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, others include Henri-Edmond Cross, Maximilien Luce, Albert Dubois-Pillet, and for a period Pissarro and Van Gogh. It was influential on fauvism, and elements of the style appeared in expressionism, cubism, and early abstraction. Synthetism (Cloisonnism c. 1888–1903) Cloisonnism was conceived by Émile Bernard and immediately taken up and developed by Paul Gauguin and others while at an artists' colony in Pont-Aven (Brittany, France). The style resembled cloisonné enamel or stained glass, with flat, bold colors outlined in black or dark colors. Synthetism, exemplified in the work of Gauguin and Paul Sérusier, is slightly a broader term with less emphasis on dark outlines and cloisonné qualities. Other artist include Cuno Amiet, Louis Anquetin, Charles Filiger, Jacob Meyer de Haan, Charles Laval, and Armand Seguin. Their work greatly influenced fauvism and expressionism. Les Nabis (c. 1890–1905: Hebrew for prophets or illuminati) was a larger movement in France and Belgium that eclectically drew on progressive elements in synthetism, neo-impressionism, symbolism, and Art Nouveau. Perhaps more influential than the art, were the numerous theories, manifestoes, and infectious enthusiasm for the avant-garde, setting the tone for the proliferation of movements and ""isms"" in the first quarter of the 20th century. La Revue Blanche often published Les Nabis and symbolist content. The work of Édouard Vuillard,[142][143] and Pierre Bonnard,[144][145] ca. 1890–1910 is exemplary of Les Nabis, though both evolved in their styles and produced significant work into the 1940s. Other artist include Maurice Denis, Maxime Dethomas, Meyer de Haan, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Georges Lacombe, Aristide Maillol, Paul Ranson, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Armand Séguin, Paul Sérusier, Félix Vallotton, Jan Verkade, and others."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"The history of 20th-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. The art movements of Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, abstract art, Dadaism and Surrealism led to further explorations of new creative styles and manners of expression. Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art, such as Pablo Picasso being influenced by Iberian sculpture, African sculpture and Primitivism. Japonism, and Japanese woodcuts (which had themselves been influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent artistic developments. The influential example set by Paul Gauguin's interest in Oceanic art and the sudden popularity among the cognoscenti in early 20th century Paris of newly discovered African fetish sculptures and other works from non-European cultures were taken up by Picasso, Henri Matisse, and many of their colleagues. Later in the 20th century, Pop Art and Abstract Expressionism came to prominence.

,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Art Nouveau is an international style of art, architecture and applied art, especially the decorative arts, characterised by its two main sources of inspiration: use of plant-shaped ornaments (sinuous curves); and historical art styles (like Gothic, Celtic, Byzantine, Rococo and Baroque), especially Japanese art.

The cult of nature, with its sinuous curves and tendrils of ivy that almost appear to take root within an item of furniture or decorative arts, was a popular theme for Art Nouveau. It was through this medium that women were most often portrayed as stylised objects rather than people. Through the use of nature as an idiom, designers hoped to incorporate all aspects of life into a single object or interior: the outside was brought inside and the human relationship with the environment was explored.

In Spain, Italy, Russia and the US artists and designers added to the novel and fascinating interpretations of Art Nouveau. Every culture drew on different sources of inspiration including Gothic, Celtic, Byzantine, Rococo and Baroque. While historical influences were present they could not be justified unless they were approached with innovation rather than tradition. The portrayal of women in art at the turn of the century highlights another important challenge to contemporary societies. In many instances women were depicted as fantasy figures, interplaying with nature, united with it. By contrast, the gritty realism of paintings by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec demonstrated that women could be portrayed as genuine people involved in mundane aspects of their daily lives.[146]

The earliest influences of Art Nouveau began to emerge in England among figures such as John Ruskin, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement, which paralleled some aspects of symbolist sensibilities in France and Belgium at that time. Art Nouveau is closely allied and intermingled with symbolism. The term Art Nouveau is most often applied to architecture, crafts, and decorative arts, while symbolism is more commonly used for fine arts like painting and sculpture as well as poetry and literature, however there are no hard, defining lines between the two. Art Nouveau was an international movement that spread throughout Europe and North America reaching its peak around 1890–1905. It perhaps found its greatest expressions in architecture, influenced by theorist and historian Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, and seen in the work of Victor Horta, Hector Guimard, Louis Sullivan, and Antoni Gaudí. However extraordinary examples of the style appeared in interior design, furniture, wallpaper, textiles, mosaics, ceramics, metalworking, jewelry, art glass, stained glass windows, and other decorative and applied arts produced by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Peter Carl Fabergé, Émile Gallé, René Lalique, Louis Comfort Tiffany, and many others. Japanese art, particularly the woodcut prints, with design concepts that were new to Europeans began to appear and found receptive audiences there, where graphic artist such as Aubrey Beardsley, Jules Chéret, Walter Crane, Eugène Grasset, Alphonse Mucha, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec designed innovative posters, advertising, fashions, book binding, frontispieces, and illustrations.[147][148]

Art Nouveau often abandoned geometric forms and angles in favor of arabesque lines suggestive of vegetation, winding vines, and other elements of nature. Many artisans sought to breakdown the divide between fine art, applied art, and decorative art and merge them all into every aspect of daily life. Individual artist frequently moved back and forth between various disciplines and worked in several media. It was not unusual for architects to produce the furniture and other furnishings for the houses and building they designed, for painters to design advertising posters and book illustrations, or jewelers to produce art glass, and stained glass windows."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Fauvism emerged from post-impressionism, gradually developing into the first major movement of the 20th century. Its genesis was in 1895 when Henri Matisse, the oldest and central figure, entered the studio of Gustave Moreau at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. There he met Georges Rouault, Charles Camoin, Henri Manguin, and Albert Marquet. Marquet said ""As early as 1898 Matisse and I were working in what was later to be called the Fauve manner. The first exhibitions at the Indepéndants in which we were, I believe, the only ones to paint in pure tones, go back to 1901.""[150] By 1902–03 the circle of like-minded artist had grown to include Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy, Othon Friesz, Jean Metzinger, Jean Puy, Louis Valtat, Kees van Dongen, and Maurice de Vlaminck. During this period a number of influential retrospective exhibitions were held in Paris: Seurat (1900, 1905), Van Gogh (1901, 1905), Toulouse-Lautrec (1902), Gauguin (1906), Cezanne (1907), all relatively unknown to the public at that time. Matisse and Derain collected African carvings, a novel but growing curiosity of the time. Matisse spent the summer of 1904 in Saint-Tropez painting with the neo-impressionist Paul Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross, followed in1905 by Camoin, Manguin, and Marquet. The artist exhibited regularity at the Salon des Indepéndants and the Salon d'Automne 1903–1908 and in 1905 their work created a sensation and a scandal. Matisse stated ""We were exhibiting at the Salon d'Automne, Derain, Manguin, Marquet, Puy, and a few others were hung together in one of the larger galleries. In the center of this room the sculptor Marque exhibited a bust of a child very much in the Italian style. Vauxcelles [art critic for Gil Blas] entered the room and said, Well! well! Donatello in the mist of wild beasts! [Donatello chez les fauves].""[151] The movement had not been perceived as an entity by the public, but once published the name stuck. Unlike the impressionist and their long struggle for acceptance, the avant-garde had an eager audience by 1906–1907 and the fauvist were attracting collectors from America to Russia. However fauvism largely dissolved in 1908, as cubism appeared, most of the artist began exploring other styles and moving in different directions. Only Matisse and Dufy continued to explore fauvism into the 1950s.[150]<[152][153][154][155]

The fauvist painted landscapes en plein air, interiors, figures, and still lifes, following examples of realism, impressionism, and post-impressionism. They applied paint with loose brushstrokes, in thick, unnatural, often contrasting, vibrant colors, at times straight from the tube. Gauguin's influence, with his exploration of the expressive values and spatial aspects of patterning with flat, pure colors, as well as his interest in primitivism were significant, as was neo-impressionism. Matisse explained – for a long time color served as a complement of design, the painters of the Renaissance constructed the picture by line, adding local color afterwards – writing: ""From Delacroix to Van Gogh and chiefly to Gauguin, by way of the Impressionist, who cleared the ground, and Cézanne, who gave the final impulse and introduced colored volumes, we can follow this rehabilitation of color's function, this restoration of its emotive power""[150] Fauvism was the culmination in a shift, from drawing and line as the fundamental foundations of design in painting to color, and they depicted their subjects on the verge of abstraction."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Expressionism was an international movement in painting, sculpture, the graphic arts, poetry, literature, theater, film, and architecture. Some associate the Second Viennese School and other music of the period with the movement. Most historians place the beginning of expressionism in 1905 with the founding of the Die Brücke. However, several artist were producing influential work that was in the spirit of expressionism c. 1885–1905 including Lovis Corinth, James Ensor, Käthe Kollwitz, Paula Modersohn-Becker, Edvard Munch, Emil Nolde, and Christian Rohlfs among others. Many of these artist later exhibited and associated with various expressionist groups. Expressionist painting is characterized by loose, spontaneous, frequently thick, impasto brushwork. It often conveyed how the artist felt about their subject, opposed to what it looked like, putting intuition and gut feelings over realistic representations or art theories. Expressionism was frequently infused with an angst or joy, and an overall engagement with contemporary life and social issues that was often absent from fauvism's focus on design and color applied to neutral subjects. Woodcut prints are particularly noteworthy in expressionism. Expressionism can sometimes overlap and integrate with other styles and movements, such as symbolism, fauvism, cubism, futurism, abstraction, and dada. Several groups and factions of expressionist appeared at various times and places.[116][141][116][156][157]

Die Brücke (The Bridge: 1905 -1913) aspired to connect ""all revolutionary and surging elements.""[156] It was founded by four architectural students Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, and Fritz Bleyl. Sharing a studio in Dresden they produced paintings, carvings, prints, and organized exhibitions, separating in the summer to work independently. Their first exhibit was in 1905, later joined by Emil Nolde and Max Pechstein in 1906, and Otto Mueller in 1910 among others. Influences included Gothic art, primitivism, Art Nouveau, and developments in Paris, particularly Van Gogh and fauvism. The group shifted to Berlin in 1911 and later dissolved in 1913. Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider: 1911–1914), founded by Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc, was a relatively informal group that organized exhibitions of art from Paris and Europe, as well their own. It was one in a series of increasingly progressive groups splitting from the Art Academy in Munich including The Munich Secession in 1892 (realist & impressionist), Phalanx in 1901 (postimpressionist), Neue Kunstler Vereiningung in 1909, and The Blue Rider in 1911. Artist associated with the latter two groups included the Burliuk brothers, Heinrich Campendonk, Alexej von Jawlensky, Paul Klee, August Macke, Gabriele Münter, and Marianne von Werefkin. The euphonious almanac Der Blaue Reiter, a collection of influential essays, and Kandinsky's Concerning the Spiritual in Art with his ideas on non-objective art were both published in 1912. The Blue Rider ended with the outbreak of World War I in which Macke and Marc both died.[116][141][158][156][157]

Other artists such as Oskar Kokoschka, Egon Schiele, and Richard Gerstl emerged in Austria. French artist Georges Rouault and Chaim Soutine had affinities with the movement. Sculptors include Ernst Barlach, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Gerhard Marcks, and William Wauer. Architects associated with expressionism include Max Berg, Hermann Finsterlin, Johann Friedrich Höger, Michel de Klerk, Erich Mendelsohn, Hans Poelzig, Hans Scharoun, Rudolf Steiner, and Bruno Taut. Der Sturm (The Storm 1910–1932) was a magazine with much expressionist content founded by Herwarth Walden, with an associated gallery in Berlin opened in 1912 and a theater company and school in opened 1918. Films regarded as expressionistic, some considered as classics, include The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Robert Wiene, 1920), Nosferatu (F. W. Murnau,1922), and Metropolis (Fritz Lang, 1927).[116][141][158][156][157]

After World War I a tendency to withdraw from the avant-garde by many artist occurred, seen in the work of the original fauvists during the 1920s, Picasso and Stravinsky's neoclassical periods, and De Chirico's late work. This tendency was called New Objectivity (ca. 1919–1933) in Germany, and in contrast to the nostalgic nature of this work elsewhere, it was characterized by disillusionment and ruthless social criticisms. New objectivity artists mostly emerged from expressionist and dada milieus including Otto Dix, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter, Georg Scholz, and Jeanne Mammen. Max Beckmann and George Grosz also had some association with new objectivity for a period. Although not intrinsically expressionistic, the Staatliches Bauhaus (School of Building: 1919–1933) was an influential German school merging crafts, decorative, and fine arts. Moving from Weimar, to Dessau, to Berlin, it changed and evolved in focus with time. Directors included architects Walter Gropius (1919–1928), Hannes Meyer (1928–1930), and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1930–1933). At various points the faculty included Josef Albers, Theo van Doesburg, Lyonel Feininger, Johannes Itten, Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, El Lissitzky, Gerhard Marcks, László Moholy-Nagy, Oskar Schlemmer. Bauhaus architects greatly influenced the International Style, which was characterized by simplified forms, a lack of ornamentation, a union of design and function, and the idea that mass production could be compatible with personal artistic vision. As the Nazi Party rose to power, modern art was dubbed ""degenerate art"" and the Bauhaus was closed in 1933, subduing modernism in Germany for several years."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Cubism consisted in the rejection of perspective, which leads to a new organisation of space where viewpoints multiply producing a fragmentation of the object that renders the predilection for form over the content of the representation obvious. Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and other Cubist artists were inspired by the sculptures of Iberia, Africa and Oceania exhibited in the Louvre and the ethnographic museum in the Trocadéro, and which were being offered at flee markets and in sale rooms.

'A Picasso studies an object the way a surgeon dissects a corpse,' wrote the critic and poet Guillaume Apollinaire in 1913. Five years earlier, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque – friends, colleagues and rivals – had begun to reject perspectival realism for a form of artistic autopsy: an utterly revolutionary painting style that looked inside and around objects, presenting them analytically, objectively and completely impersonally."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Surrealism emerged as a faction of Dada, formally announcing its inception in 1924 with André Breton's Manifesto of Surrealism.[160] Originally a literary group of poets and writers in Paris, it soon developed into an international movement that included painters, sculptors, photographers, and filmmakers. A Second Manifeste du Surréalisme was published in 1929.[161] Surrealism did not have significant expression in applied or decorative arts, architecture, or music, although a few isolated examples could be identified (e.g. chess sets, furniture, and Las Pozas). The small and short lived Metaphysical School (c. 1910–1921), with Giorgio de Chirico as its principal figure, was highly influential on surrealism. The surrealist explored a myriad of innovative techniques, some had recently been developed in Cubism and Dada, others were new, including collage, found objects, assemblage, random chance, rayographs (photograms), painting on sand, dripping and flinging paint, decalcomania, frottage, fumage, and raclage. Two fundamental approaches predominate surrealist art. Automatism dominated in the early years which can be seen in the work of artist like André Masson and Joan Miró. Other artist, swayed by work of Giorgio de Chirico, used more traditional methods and mediums to illustrate unfiltered thoughts and incongruous juxtapositions, including Salvador Dali and René Magritte. Significant artist include Jean Arp, Hans Bellmer, Victor Brauner, Luis Buñuel, Joseph Cornell, Óscar Domínguez, Max Ernst, Wifredo Lam, Yves Tanguy, Man Ray, Alberto Giacometti, Méret Oppenheim, and Roberto Matta. Other important artist informally accosted with surrealism include Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, and Frida Kahlo. Surrealist ideas and theories were discussed in a successive series of journals, La Révolution Surréaliste (1924–1929), Le Surrealisme au service de la revolution (1930–1933), Minotaure (1933–1939), VVV (1942–1944). The automatic paintings produced by André Masson and Joan Miró, as well as latecomers to surrealism like Roberto Matta and Arshile Gorky had a considerable influenced on the abstract expressionist in the late 1940s.[162][163][164][165][166][167]

With a measure of Dada's irreverence and contempt for the traditional political, religious, and bourgeois values of western culture that they believed had led the world into the First World War (Breton and other founding members were veterans); the surrealist explored the possibilities that had been opened up by Sigmund Freud regarding the subconscious mind: ""Pure psychic automatism, by which one intends to express verbally, in writing or by any other method, the real functioning of the mind. Dictation by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason, and beyond any aesthetic or moral preoccupation.""[160] Surrealism sought to express pure thought, unfiltered and uncensored by political, religious, moral, or rational principles"
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"The term 'Pop' first appeared in print in an article by English critic Lawrence Alloway in 1958, but the new interest in popular culture, and the attempt to make art out of it, was a feature of the Independent Group in London from the early 1950s. Richard Hamilton, Eduardo Paolozzi and other discussed the growing mass culture of movies, advertising, science fiction, consumerism, media and communications, product design and new technologies originating in America, but now spreading through the west. They were particularly fascinated by advertising, and graphic, and product design, and wanted to make art and architecture that had a similarly seductive appeal. Hamilton's collage Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? (1956), made from American magazine advertisements, was the first work to achieve iconic status. The next generation of students in London, including Patrick Caulfield and David Hockney, also incorporated popular culture into their collages and assemblages, and in the period between 1959 and 1962 achieved public notoriety.

In the early 1960s, in the United States themselves, the public saw for the first time the works that since have become famous: Andy Warhol's Marilyn Monroe, Roy Lichtenstein's comic-strip oils, Claes Oldenberg's gigantiv vinyl burgers and ice cream cones, and Tom Wesselmann's nudes set in domestic settings that incorporate real shower curtains, telephones and bathroom cabinets. Public attention culminated in a large international exhibition mounted at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York in 1962. Works by British, French, Italian, Swedish and American artists were grouped around the themes of the 'daily object', 'mass media', and the 'repetition' or 'accumulation' of mass-produced objects. It was a defining moment. Sidney Janis was the leading dealer in blue-chip European moderns and Abstract Expressionists, and his exhibition consecrated the work as the next art historical movement to be discussed and collected."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Rapid advances in science and technology led to the late Modern and Postmodern period. In these periods, the art and cultures of the world went through many changes, and there was a great deal of intermixture between cultures, as new communications technologies facilitated the national and even global dissemination of music, art and style. The separation of regional cultures that had marked the 19th century was replaced by a global culture. Postmodernism describes a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late-20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture, and criticism which marked a departure from modernism.[170][171][172] One contemporary view of Postmodern art shows that it can be understood as an expansion of technology-based media enabling multiple new forms of art simultaneously.[173] The transition from linear art movements of the early 20th century modern era to multiple simultaneous movements of the last 20th century Postmodern is shown in a Timeline of 20th.C Art and New Media.[174] Art movements specific of the late 20th and early 21st centuries include land art, video art, photorealism, hyperrealism, and digital art."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"People reflect their lives in art. Real, live art appeals to the heart and mind of every person, to their feelings and ideals, it proclaims life. Art is truthful only when it serves life, only when the artist hopes to arouse a warm response in the heart of a person. That was the case in the days of Giotto and Raphael, that was the case in the subsequent stages of the world's artistic development, and that was the truthful relationship of art and life in the days of Renato Guttuso and Rockwell Kent. Art belongs to people.

The history of art from the Renaissance to our days confirms this. It is close contact with the life of the nation that gives artists' work its power.

One can see masterpieces of old and modern art in various picture galleries and museums. There is nearly a thousand museums in Russia, many of them are world famous. The largest collection of Russian art is the Tretyakov Art Gallery in Moscow. It is a real treasury of canvases by prominent Russian painters. It contains priceless collections of icons, 17—20th century paintings and sculptures and contemporary Russian paintings and sculpture.

One of the largest and most remarkable museums of the world is the Hermitage, more than three hundred halls housing its exhibitions of articles of the greatest artistic value. The museum's collections now comprise works of various periods in the development of art, from ancient times up to the present day. Famous painters from different countries are represented there.

The Russian Museum in St. Petersburg is another picture gallery which contains the richest collection of Russian paintings of 18-19th centuries and the best collection of Russian sculpture.

In the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow the art of the Ancient East and Western Europe is represented. This museum possesses a unique collection of copies of the finest sculptures of the old time. It is in this museum that many famous foreign expositions of fine art are displayed almost every year."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"An art museum is a building or space for the display of art, usually from the museum's own collection. It might be in public or private ownership and may be accessible to all or have restrictions in place. Although primarily concerned with visual art, art museums are often used as a venue for other cultural exchanges and artistic activities, such as performance arts, music concerts, or poetry readings. Art museums also frequently host themed temporary exhibitions, which often include items on loan from other collections.

Gallery is a general term for any building or room used to display art, but unlike an art gallery operated by an art dealer, works from the collection of an art museum are not generally for sale, but held in public trust.[1] Removal of a work from the collection of a museum is deaccessioning, a process defined by the museum's collection management policy."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Throughout history, large and expensive works of art have generally been commissioned by religious institutions and monarchs and been displayed in temples, churches, and palaces. Although these collections of art were private, they were often made available for viewing for a portion of the public. In classical times, religious institutions began to function as an early form of art gallery. Wealthy Roman collectors of engraved gems (including Julius Caesar) and other precious objects often donated their collections to temples. It is unclear how easy it was in practice for the public to view these items.


The art collection at the Palace of Versailles in France was periodically open for 'respectable' public viewing.
In Europe, from the Late Medieval period onwards, areas in royal palaces, castles, and large country houses of the social elite were often made partially accessible to sections of the public, where art collections could be viewed. At the Palace of Versailles, entrance was restricted to people wearing the proper apparel – the appropriate accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside. The treasuries of cathedrals and large churches, or parts of them, were often set out for public display. Many of the grander English country houses could be toured by the respectable for a tip to the housekeeper, during the long periods when the family were not in residence.

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with most of the paintings of the Orleans Collection, which were housed in a wing of the Palais-Royal in Paris and could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy, the art tourism of the Grand Tour became a major industry from the 18th century onwards, and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The Capitoline Museums began in 1471 with a donation of classical sculpture to the city of Rome by the Papacy, while the Vatican Museums, whose collections are still owned by the Pope, trace their foundation to 1506, when the recently discovered Laocoön and His Sons was put on public display. A series of museums on different subjects were opened over subsequent centuries, and many of the buildings of the Vatican were purpose-built as galleries. An early royal treasury opened to the public was the Green Vault of the Kingdom of Saxony in the 1720s.

Privately established museums open to the public began to be established from the 17th century onwards, often based around a collection of the cabinet of curiosities type. The first such museum was the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, opened in 1683 to house and display the artefacts of Elias Ashmole that were given to Oxford University in a bequest."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"The Kunstmuseum Basel, through its lineage which extends back to the Amerbach Cabinet, which included a collection of works by Hans Holbein the Younger and purchased by the city of Basel in 1661,[2] is the first museum of art open to the public in the world.

In the second half of the eighteenth century, many private collections of art were opened to the public, and during and after the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars many royal collections were nationalized, even where the monarchy remained in place, as in Spain and Bavaria.

In 1753, the British Museum was established and the Old Royal Library collection of manuscripts was donated to it for public viewing. In 1777, a proposal to the British government was put forward by MP John Wilkes to buy the art collection of the then late Sir Robert Walpole who had amassed one of the greatest such collections in Europe, and house it in a specially built wing of the British Museum for public viewing. After much debate, the idea was eventually abandoned due to the great expense, and twenty years later, the collection was bought by Tsaritsa Catherine the Great of Russia and housed in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.[3]

The Bavarian royal collection (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich) was opened to the public in 1779 and the Medici collection in Florence around 1789[4] (as the Uffizi Gallery). The opening of the Musée du Louvre during the French Revolution in 1793 as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection marked an important stage in the development of public access to art by transferring the ownership to a republican state; but it was a continuation of trends already well established.[5] The building now occupied by the Prado in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries were opened to the public in Vienna, Munich and other capitals. In Great Britain, however, the corresponding Royal Collection remained in the private hands of the monarch and the first purpose-built national art galleries were the Dulwich Picture Gallery, founded in 1814 and the National Gallery, London opened to the public a decade later in 1824. Similarly, the National Gallery in Prague was not formed by opening an existing royal or princely art collection to the public but was created from scratch as a joint project of some Czech aristocrats in 1796.

The Corcoran Gallery of Art is generally considered to have been the first art museum in the United States.[6] It was originally housed in the Renwick Gallery built in 1859. Now a part of the Smithsonian Institution, the Renwick houses William Wilson Corcoran's collection of American and European art. The building was designed by James Renwick, Jr. and finally completed in 1874.[7][8] It is located at 1661 Pennsylvania Avenue NW.[9] Renwick designed it after the Louvre's Tuileries addition.[10] At the time of its construction, it was known as ""the American Louvre"".[11][12]"
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"University art museums and galleries constitute collections of art developed, owned, and maintained by all kinds of schools, community colleges, colleges, and universities. This phenomenon exists in the West and East, making it a global practice. Although overlooked, there are over 700 university art museums in the US alone. This number, compared to other kinds of art museums, makes university art museums perhaps the largest category of art museums in the country. While the first of these collections can be traced to learning collections developed in art academies in Western Europe, they are now associated with and housed in centers of higher education of all types."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Works on paper, such as drawings, pastels, watercolors, prints, and photographs are typically not permanently displayed for conservation basis. Instead, public access to these materials is provided by a dedicated print room located within the museum. Murals generally remain where they have been painted, although many have been removed to galleries. Various forms of 20th-century art, such as land art and performance art, also usually exist outside a gallery. Photographic records of these kinds of art are often shown in galleries, however. Most museum and large art galleries own more works than they have room to display. The rest are held in reserve collections, on or off-site.

Similar to an art gallery is the sculpture garden (or ""sculpture park""), which presents sculpture in an outdoor space. Sculpture installation has grown in popularity, whereby temporary sculptures are installed in open spaces during events like festivals."
,,,,,arts,,,,,,,,,"Most larger paintings from about 1530 onwards were designed to be seen either in churches or (increasingly) palaces, and many buildings built as palaces now function successfully as art museums. By the 18th century additions to palaces and country houses were sometimes intended specifically as galleries for viewing art, and designed with that in mind. The architectural form of the entire building solely intended to be an art gallery was arguably established by Sir John Soane with his design for the Dulwich Picture Gallery in 1817. This established the gallery as a series of interconnected rooms with largely uninterrupted wall spaces for hanging pictures and indirect lighting from skylights or roof lanterns.

The late 19th century saw a boom in the building of public art galleries in Europe and America, becoming an essential cultural feature of larger cities. More art galleries rose up alongside museums and public libraries as part of the municipal drive for literacy and public education.

In the middle and late twentieth century, earlier architectural styles employed for art museums (such as the Beaux-Arts style of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City or the Gothic and Renaissance Revival architecture of Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum) succumbed to modern styles, such as Deconstructivism. Examples of this trend include the Guggenheim Museum in New York City by Frank Lloyd Wright, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao by Frank Gehry, Centre Pompidou-Metz by Shigeru Ban, and the redesign of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art by Mario Botta. Some critics[which?] argue these galleries defeat their purposes because their dramatic interior spaces distract the eye from the paintings they are supposed to exhibit."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"It 's an interesting world we live in when comedians such as Jon Stewart are more trusted to give truthful, adequate information rather than news outlets and the media. What seems like a curious predicament is really nothing more than the creation of a monetized media, the value of a persons ' interest in a headline. In Media, poor ethics and sensationalism caused by greed have led to unfortunate effects such as misinformation, idolization of celebrities, and reduced credibility of news outlets as a whole. First and foremost, the largest and most unfortunate result of this sensationalism is misinformation to the general public. The need for viewership causes media to exaggerate their stories, trying to create the biggest, boldest headline for it, and in the process often citing inflated or even outright incorrect information. The rampant question; who can make the biggest, boldest headline in the shortest amount of time? The drive to captivate and take the attention of the public in order to turn a profit is what drives this cash cow. Ultimately, in their eyes, you are nothing more than a view to them. A number on a computer screen, that will transform into money. This leads to misinformation of often important stories, which can create unfortunate side effects such as racial tension and misdirected anger. As the internet grows in popularity, the need for news has only increased, now booming in the way of internet articles who are just as guilty of sensationalism. Clic

,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"The media reaches over a 100 million people a day. Due to its tremendous audience and the impact it has, the media has been able to change public opinion, American policy, and even American history. The media’s powerful influence can be seen through its portrayal of major events like the Vietnam War, The Spanish-American War, Watergate and several others. Through the years the role of media in publish affairs has changed as its influence has grown. The focus of my research is on how media originated and its influence on several historical events.

When the media began, it had a political agenda. It was an outlet through which the common people would criticize the government. The right to criticize was established in 1735 by John Peter Zenger, the first journalist to criticize the government in his newspaper, The New York Weekly Journal.
Zenger was jailed by the government, but found not guilty by the jury. This was the first time anyone had publicly protested against the government, fought persecution in the courts and won. Thus, this case set the precedent for the First Amendment.Is Mass Media Harming our Society? In today’s society, mass media, including television, radio, and newspaper or magazines have become very dependable sources to so many people. People spend many hours everyday reading about celebrities in the tabloids, watching biased news channels, or participating in violent video games. Even though most media is highly entertaining, people have become so reliant on media that we seem to be harming our community in a very negative fashion. Be advertising it on the front page of table.Mass media works as a socializing factor and affects the way we view the world and how we interact with other people."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"However, the messages that are seen in most of the magazines these days are negative images, especially for the youth of the world. For example, on the front page of popular magazines such as Teen and Cosmopolitan, are celebrities whom are extremely thin and suffer from eating disorders or celebrities who are abusing drugs and alcohol and getting away with it. Both of these situations are extremely popular topics, especially in high school and college, and there is no reason we shouldMass Media: The media, which is somewhat reflective of society, has become a powerful tool in shaping our culture. Advertisements are the foundation for mass media; they sell images, values, success, normalcy, and romance. Daily, we are exposed to advertisements whether they are written or commercial.

Advertisements have social consequences that give them the ability to reinforce objectification of women’s bodies, and display images that may cause male violence against women, sexualize young girls, infantile grown women.Impact of Mass Media on Individuals, Society, and Culture: The main Impact of Mass Media on Individuals, Society, and Culture , over the years, has had a profound effect on American society, on its culture, and on the individuals exposed to the media. Mass media is a form of socialization, having a long-term effect on each member of American society. While mass media targets the individual in short-term intervals, the overall influence on them has been established as the consumer moves from one impressionable age category to another.The long or short- term effects of mass media are separate and distinct when its role in America is evaluated. Mass media effects people differently because of varied amounts of exposure and formats."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Mass media has a socialization function in American society, in the culture, and on individuals. Mass media has played a role of socialization in our society over the years: Socialization is a long-term process that every human being undergoes as he or she becomes a functioning member of society.Socialization refers to the internalizing of all of the lessons from many sources concerning ways of behaving. By Mass Media I mean ‘the whole body of media reaching large numbers of public’ the major ones being newspapers, television and the World Wide Web also now as internet. The main purposes of mass media are to provide information, entertainment and advertisement. In this essay I will discuss the influence that Mass Media has in the general public and giving the evidence to support the statement “People are more influenced by mass media than they think.The history of mass media can be said that started from the ancient Greece.

Philosophers, generals and politicians of the ancient Society discuss issues and after spread to the public by the use of word of mouth. The ancient Greek Drama and poetry can be considered as a form of mass media, communicates a message to the society. In other words since the early years people has always being influenced by Mass Media. In today’s world people cannot leave without Mass Media and with the help of technological improvement. The Social Benefits of Mass Communication: Mass communications, like anything for humans, has its advantages and disadvantages, but mass media has far more advantages to offer the world. From taking you to a far off land to teaching you about the intricacies of the life inside a colony of ants, to surfing the Internet for a new chat group to join, we learn and experience things and events that no humans ever before in history have experienced through this miracle we call mass media. This paper will explore the multifaceted and unique areas of the public’s perception of mass media, the educational value of the media, and the Internet as a new mass medium.The public has always had an interesting relationship with mass media because it is the public that is breaths life into this organism called the mass media machine.

From the earliest time periods in human history mass media was communicated through “word of mouth,” and it was that very relationship that spawned small town gossip in the middle ages. Mass Media And Technologies: Back in the 18th century, it took very little effort to have fun. Simple games, such as hopscotch, jump rope and other activities made from natural materials brought laughter and happiness to families across the world."

Yellow Journalism and Mass Media: It is the news that informs us of the events that change our lives and entertains us when we are seeking something to do. Journalism has been the staple of American life for quite some time and will probably keep the same effect for years to come. Journalism has also changed many lives in American History. Furthermore, I leave you with my essay on the the hype of the early nineteen hundreds; the infamous Yellow Press. Basically, Yellow Journalism was the given name to mass media in the early eighteenth century.It consisted of cartoons, illustrations, catchy stories, and things that appealed to the readers interests and values (Mass Media 1). Sometimes the contents were fraudulent and emphasized tragedies.

These types of contents sold papers in great volumes and created a large profit for such papers as the “New York World” and the “Journal. ”(Century 168) The owner of the “New York Journal” and the overall founder of yellow journalism itself was of the name Joseph Pulitzer. Pulitzer immigrated to the United States from Hungary(Pulitzer 1). Early on in his career he worked as a reporter where he picked up most of his journalism skills.

Later on, Pulitzer purchased the “New York World. ” At the time the “World” was not very successful, but Pulitzer managed to turn it into one of the most successful papers in New York. He managed to make his paper successful. Types of Mass Media: There are two types of mass media. •Print Media •Electronic Media. We have just completed the mass media century.

The twentieth century was the most populated, most warlike, most violent, most intentive, most technologically progressive and also the most communicative century in human history.In 1900, newspapers were the largest medium and they had just come into that role in the previous 20 or 30 years. The twentieth century saw the development of motion pictures, radio, television and computer. At the beginning of the twenty first century, the catch word is global media, because the mass media giants now send their messages out worldwide. Our world today is increasingly driven by a combination of information and entertainment values and these are both promoted by the explosion of different means of communication.The role of the mass media in global society has been evolving over the past century towards the following goals and duties.

The media informs the public, provides information, generates political ideas, mobilizes political and social action groups and generally helps to shape the public policy agenda and priorities. The media plays a role of political accountability and check and balances, keeping an eye on public officials and institutions and constantly challenging them via reports, interviews etc. Very rarely can the mass media actually make people change their minds or their views instantly.The media primarily reinforce views that people hold. In the last 50 years the media influence has grown exponentially with the advance of technology, first there was a telegraph, then the radio, the newspaper, magazine, television and now the internet."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"We live in a society that depends on information and communication to keep moving in the right direction and do our daily activities like work, entertainment, travelling and anything else that we have to do. Of all the media distribution channels the most influential has been the television. Of all the electronic media, television is the king.We are constantly exposed to thousands of images of violence, advertising and much more. The media takes billions of dollars with the advertising they sell and that we are exposed to.

We buy what we are told to be good, after seeming thousands of advertising we make our buying decisions. The media has a huge impact on society and also in public opinion. They can shape the public opinion in different ways depending of what is the objective. The media shape people’s attitudes about everything from soap to politics. Our job is to give people not what they want, but what we decide they ought to have.

We are overwhelmed by mass media.Mass media provide information on a vast array of issues and events that are necessary to our lives everyday like: The actions of our political leaders, the votes of our representatives, the attitudes and opinions of people, the daily performance of the stock market, health news, weather forecast, scores of our favourite sports team etc, without which we could not exist as a civilized society in the twenty first century. Mass media entertain us through shallow dramas, sitcoms, soaps etc.

Other arguments for mass media? Before dismissing mass media, it is worth seeing whether there are other justifications for them.Perhaps there are some overlooked arguments for maintaining mass media even in a fully participatory society. It is worth canvassing a few of them. •Emergencies The mass media, especially radio and television, can come in handy in emergencies: messages can be broadcast, reaching a large fraction of the population. But the mass media are not really necessary for emergency purposes. Fire alarms, for example, do not rely on conventional media."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Furthermore, network media, including telephone and computer networks, can be set up to allow emergency communications.Actually, the mass media are a great vulnerability in certain emergencies: military coups. Because they allow a few people to communicate to a large population with little possibility of dialogue, television and radio stations are commonly the first targets in military takeovers. Censorship of newspapers is a next step. This connection between coups and mass media also highlights the role of mass media in authoritarian regimes.

Military strength is no defence against a military coup, and indeed may be the cause of one. To resist a coup, network communications are far superior to mass media.So, from the point of view of preparing for emergencies, mass media are bad investments.

•Media talent The mass media allow many people to enjoy and learn from the efforts of some highly talented performers and personalities, including actors, musicians, athletes, journalists and commentators. True. But even without mass media, it is possible for people to enjoy and learn from these talented individuals, for example through audio and video recordings.

Furthermore, the mass media limit access to all but a few performers and contributors.Those who are left out have a much better chance of reaching a sympathetic audience via network media. •A force for good The mass media are undoubtedly powerful. In the right hands, they can be a powerful force for good purposes. Therefore, it might be argued, the aim should be to promote a mass media that is overseen by responsible, accountable people.

This sounds like a good argument. What it overlooks is how easily power corrupts. Whoever has power in the mass media is susceptible to the corruptions of power, including power sought for its own sake and for self-enrichment. Large resources The mass media command enormous resources, both financial and symbolic.

,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Despite 40 million poor people being in the nation, less than one in 500 articles in New York Times and one in thousand articles in Readers Guide to Periodic Literature are about poverty. The highly concentrated media businesses tend to ignore poor people and portray them as a negative aspect of the society.  Poor people and their misery is often unnoticed and is masked by  and misleading stories and are even turned into statistics used for debates and discussions. The media points out poverty as the failure of what poor people do and identifies it as a part of cycle, which includes poor people and their deprivation; So basically, poor people and poverty are depicted as causes and effects of each other.  Therefore, the media seems to mark poor people as unimportant and often, false and unimportant aspects are portrayed in their stories.



2.	The media generally tends to prioritize concerns of wealthy people and presents their concerns as the concerns of all. For example, the news media focuses more on stocks and business news although relatively few people own them. Mostly, the media focuses on interests of high class and success stories but fails to notice the impact of rich class on national level policies which include corporate lobbying and supporting political parties. Sometimes, selected elite individuals are mocked for their personality flaws and inappropriate manners, but the media usually appears to be supporting the elite and this is mainly because the owners"

The first thing we must examine is what exactly constitutes the media in all of its forms. Foremost, the media exists absolutely everywhere. Whether that be through TV, the Internet, newspapers, and radio. Each one garners for our societies undivided attention on whatever topic it chooses to be worthy of reporting and bringing to light. Overall the mass media is a tool used to draw the attention of the general populace, generally the media is used as a means of gaining political support or a following. Although it can also be used as a more positive force in general, for example when a…show more content…
The general public views most sorts of media as a form of escapism from their normal lives, they don't watch TV or tune into news sources to see the mundane and grim things about life even if it does catch their attention at times briefly. They prefer stories on extraordinary topics. We don't want to see an image of a poor person or a starving child or a grim battlefield across the world because we can't relate to it and it exposes us to the more grim realities of our life that society has taught us to turn a blind eye to. The media would much rather report on a story such as a flood in early 2000 and in Mozambique because a woman there was forced to give birth in a tree. Although the very same day, 300 Mozambique children died from hunger and sickness and not a single news report was done on them or about their plight. The reason is because no matter what in the media's eye they need to catch the general populace's attention and a bizarre story about a baby being born in a tree will do that but a story about 300 children dying will not. As messed up and sad as it is to say the next day another 300 kids will die but more than likely a baby won't be born in a tree. The media has developed the tactic of trying to keep our attention with more simplistic and mundane things. Therefore, reporting in depth on topics such as natural disasters across the globes and political strife or events in other"

While it is convenient and comforting to have access to so much data, the question arises.  How much of this information we receive shapes our lives?  Mass media as an agent of socialization can prime and/or skew people’s belief system through mere exposure without the slightest clue of it affects.  Mass media as an agent of socialization can structure people’s perception on society as a whole by simply using influence, control, and trust. 
Media influence is the force by which ideas are injected into people’s lives shaping the very culture of society.  This influence is masqueraded through hidden media message, resulting in a change in its audience which can be positive or negative, abrupt or gradual, short term or long term. Although mass media’s influential effect can reach a wide ranged audience as an agent of socialization the responsibility to contain what it releases has not been of importance. “The media’s socially significant obligations are formally ignored.” (A.S.

Television and its self-directed version, cable, allow for the mass influence of these elements in both positive and negative ways.  The positive aspects of violence and competition within the socially accepted structures of competitive youth sports and athletics promoted on TV and in video games and equally, in the fashion, dance, and young love seen in sitcoms, movies, and MTV music videos.  Conversely, the use of junk foods, cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol combined with irresponsible, casual sex, excessive and explicit violence dominate much of the negative influence of media on America's youth.  Joseph Dominic concludes, ""that youngsters that are heavy TV viewers would display a pattern of beliefs and perceptions consistent with media portrayals (Dominick, 446). Regarding violence in mass media, again the young are exposed to a culture of violence reflected in the media.  How the media sells or promotes those perceptions is the ""reality"" of the media.  From a war somewhere in the world to the wars in someone's home, the media directs the interpretation of what is necessary, correct, moral, and immoral.

Most people find television an escape from their hectic daily lives. In our society today, there is an ongoing debate about violence in the media.

Two solutions that I would propose are for parents or any adult to reduce the exposure to media and change the impact of violent images that the kids are seeing. 

These two solutions will be affective in reducing media violence because if children are exposed to the television less, they will see less violence. This can be accomplished by enforcing limits on how much time children are glued to the screen, in addition to setting guidelines on what they can and can’t watch. This can be done through the V-chip technology. This technology was made to block programs based on their ratings category. With this device, parents can block any programs that show voluminous amounts of violence by adding a four-digit code. In fact parents don’t have to completely neglect the child during the blocking of programs. “To make the kids feel like they have some ruling in the decision. Parents can allow the children to select the programs within the family’s guidelines, while seeking to add positive programs and limiting negative ones” (Thomas 2010). 

On April 6-26, 1999 there was a random sample survey done to 1001 parents of children ages 2-17.

Print and electronic media help in awareness related to current affairs In an era of information, the impact of media, be it print or electronic, on our lives, cannot be ignored.

Can you imagine life without reading newspapers, or traveling from one channel to the other on the television screen? Gone are the days, when people used their recreational time by cycling, playing outdoor games and other such pursuits?

Our favorite intimae,today, is watching the television and unconsciously taking in whatever is being shown on it. Our opinions, thus, are not our own but what the media wants us to have.

The highly sophisticated commercialized media knows how to impact the human psyche. Watch a serial or a film, there will be umpteen advertisements which will prepare us for buying certain products. Such is the halo that they create around them that we cannot help but | acquire them.

The advertisement companies are using icons like cricket stars and actors to lure the masses into buying those products. As a matter of fact, a lot of companies are also targeting children through their advertisements because they know they can influence their parents and can force them into making choices for purchasing certain brands. It is a mad-mad world of advertisement which makes us go crazy and often makes us buy items which we do not really need; such is their spell over us. It also offers a wide variety of choices and helps consumers take decisions regarding the products available in the market."

It also voices opinions on major events etc.

A click of a button opens up a variety of channels catering to all age groups and choices. It is a treasure house of knowledge, news, education, and pure entertainment -a means of fighting boredom and loneliness.

,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Media is considered as one of the most powerful tools in providing information to people or in society. Media is part of our daily lives. It informs, influences, and entertains us. Not only they inform us, they have also the capability in shaping our lives.
 Advertisements shown on television or even in the internet can affect the viewers. Some contains violence, nudity or anything that is inappropriate to the viewers who are children or under age. They might think the information on that certain advertisement is correct without proper guidance from the parents. In the internet, there is no censorship when it comes to information resulting to some users to take this as an advantage to spread false information all over the web. That is the reason that there are some users who were victimized by scammers, bullies and etc. Medias has biases also. They have the power to manipulate thus making viewers to believe on the information they insinuate. But all of those negativities written above can be abide. Parents must be vigilant on what their children are watching. They must ensure that it is age appropriate. Users in the internet must check the authenticity of the information. They must check the origin of it to avoid fallacy. Never post something too personal like bank numbers, address or any that might put you in jeopardy. Always consider one’s privacy. In detecting biases in media, look for the sources if it involves political perspectives. Check if the headline and actual article matches. Sometimes it contains double standards. Look who’s point of view is the article is written and find alternate point of views . Biased information tries to change your mind so as an individual we must not believe immediately.   

Our main source of to get information is the media. Without media, we will never be updated on the day-today events that is happening in our surrounding. Media is used to raise awareness but sometimes they use it for biases. In using the media, we must follow some rules and etiquettes. Information is powerful but we must not abuse it. We must turn ourselves as responsible users. Media has two sides, the positive and the negative. It can help us but it has the capability to destroy us. But it all depends on us. If we let them continue to do those negative things, we are only letting them play our lives. But if we become vigilant, we can truly avoid or stop those things. Responsibility is a big word. But it is one the things that are inevitable. Every individual plays a role in the society and a responsibility to take. There is one saying that serves as a reminder, “With great power comes great responsibility.”"
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"The power of media and information and the responsibility of users
“Post, like, share, comment, research, chat, and others” is something what to do now in media. Media and information is very important to our everyday lives. It gives us the opportunity to be updated and to be aware in our surroundings. It gives us the opportunity to connect with our friends and love ones. It gives us the opportunity to be citizen journalism. It gives us the opportunity to share our opinions to the other. And also, it gives us the opportunity to challenge ourselves on how to be a responsible media and information user.   
In general, ""media"" refers to the tools of mass communication. Media today consists of television, Internet, cinema, newspapers, radio, magazines, direct mail, fax, and the telephone. Viewers can see some form of pictorial representation of messages through certain types of broadcasting and advertising. Images are visual representations, pictures, graphics, and include video, movies. Images are very useful in media to help get across messages effectively. Today, our life will remain incomplete without media. Media influence has become so powerful today that they can easily influence people positively and/or negatively. We also live in a society that depends on the media as a source of entertainment and information. Media like television enhances our knowledge by providing access to information all over the world. We can also receive different news or daily events through the television. It can be such a powerful educational tool for the younger generation helping to put them on the right path. Newspapers have a positive influence on society. Newspapers not only give information or the latest news. They also help in the positive linkage between government and the people. On the other hand, mass media can at times have a negative influence. Images in the media can have a powerful influence on our behavior. Movies, another form of mass media, today may show violence in one form or another. Images of violence somehow influence individuals and especially the younger generation to think that violence is accepted by society when it is not. Movies can also be used to show sexual images. Such images have a powerful influence on the mind and soul of young people. People who watch these images may be influenced to react in a socially unacceptable or even criminal manner. “With power comes with great responsibility.” Cyberbullying is an issue that unfortunately society has seemed to turn its cheek on. On Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or any other social media outlet, it requires little effort to harass someone. While many of these sites were created for harmless networking and fun, they have instead turned into some of the greatest tools to harm others with. We should all be responsible social media users. Derisive comments ought to never discover their way into spots that were made to be valuable wellsprings of data and fun leisure activities. Everybody should think before we click.  
The role of the media in the contemporary society is difficult to overestimate. They have become a considerable part of our life. They report about various aspects of life, form and affect public opinion."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Media comes in various forms – television, radio, newspaper and the now widely used internet. This makes media the most powerful equipment one can ever use when it comes to sharing informations and opinions. It is a channel used to relay one's message to those far at reach or in a large target of audience due to its pervasive connectivity. And in point of fact, media has an influence on every aspects of human life in modern times. Political, economical, and social values of an individual. Moreover, it has the capability to create and shape public beliefs and strengthen the society. It strives for every citizens' right to be served. Furthermore, it allows the government to connect with its nation and in the same way, helps the people aware the government of its opinions and feeling with regards to policies.
The power of media lies in the hands of its users, thus are responsible for the effects of what they do or are about to do. That being said, “with great power comes with great responsibility”. The users are solely responsible for their content – such as photos, videos, and, captions. Seeing as there are different types of media, there different responsibilities to consider. In broadcast media, for example, it is the anchors' responsibility to correspond with various sources to verify information and ensure the accuracy of any news reports. Social media, however, is in a wide range and easily is accessed by different people. Educated or not, it is their right to be a part of social media, thus allowing those irresponsible users to enter the world of media. Some do already know what are their responsibilities and are just naturally rude or moral. But there are still those who do not. And for the sake of those who do not know what they are responsible for, I'll cite the responsibilities from the blog, Just Adulting.
•Refrain from giving legal advice or legal commentary

•Do not post any comments, photos, videos, etc. that suggest or encourage illegal activity. •Avoid violating any laws and regulations, including intellectual property (IP) rights and others regarding content that you send or receive. •Never transmit any material in any manner that is disruptive, threatening, profane, abusive, harassing, embarrassing, tortuous, defamatory, obscene, libelous or is an invasion of another’s privacy •Never transmit any material that is hateful or racially, ethnically or otherwise offensive •Avoid sending unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials or any other form of solicitation. •Never transmit any material that is hateful or racially, ethnically or otherwise offensive•Avoid sending unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials or any other form of solicitation. •Never upload any software that could breach cyber security, such as malware, viruses, key loggers, trojans, etc. •If you affiliate your job with your personal social media profile, keep in mind you are representing both yourself and your employer. •Get acquainted with the unique privacy and security policies of each social media networking site and third party site you use."

Can you imagine life without reading newspaper or social medias to get information in order for us to get updated in our society? Or you as a student, can you imagine life without using any kinds of media in order for you to research your assignments? do you think that your life would be miserable without media??

  Media and information plays an important role in our society. Media refers to the tools of mass communication in which consists of television, internet, newspaper, magazines, books, radio, and cellphone or telephone. Media can give us information that we need in order for us to be updated in our society or we can be updated what is the latest trend.  In fact, media influence has become so powerful today that they can easily influence people positively or negatively. We also live in a society that people nowadays depends on the media as a source of entertainment and information.  Many people would say that their life would be incomplete without media.  Why? Because media provides an easy means of communication in which people are able to contact their friends and families from another side of the world. At the same time, media like television, radio and internet enhance our knowledge by providing access to information especially for those students like me that we badly need this media to get some information that we need. It can also be such a powerful educational tool for us or for the younger generation helping to put them on the right path for instance an educational show in television that we usually see every day like “I believe”, “math tinik” or “sesame street” is one of the TV programs that has a positive influence to younger generation. They taught the kids how to communicate effectively, to spell correctly and have fun with learning. However media have this negative effect. It can cause cyber bullying in social media that we usually encountered.
    On the other hand users should be responsible on using media like for example applying the different netiquettes and also the user knows how to disseminate information.


    The use of media can be positive and negative to the individual or society. In a positive way, media makes our lifestyle easier, for example, we can get to know what is going on out there, locally or globally, within a short space of time. Even though there are so many benefits from media images, we have to be careful not to let them influence us unknowingly. We need to be wise when using the media and we should be responsible using media and remember one of the netiquettes “ think before you click”."

Basically, the media performs three functions to inform, to influence and to entertain. But effects of these functions are multidimensional in modern times. It has provided awareness about the whole world. In twenty-first century, media has a tendency to shape political, economical and social values of an individual. Moreover, media has eliminated the boundaries of information, so that a person can become an active citizen of the global economy. Hence, it is logical to state the media has become a basic need of human civic life.

The power of media lies in its functions, as it can be illustrated by realizing its political power. Media is the cementing force of democracy, because it has supplemented the authority of people by giving them awareness about political system and its functioning. And this is the reason for which media is considered the fourth pillar of state. It strives for the rights of citizens to be served. In short, proper functioning of media is pre requisite for democracy.

For instance, generally violence on television is criticized to the great extent. Critics argue that violence shown children. This creates psychological depression and emotional instability.

Similarly, numerous advertisements on mass media has also created adverse impacts on society. Critics substantiate this fact by giving argument that advertising of expensive products cause sense of depravity in the poor people. In addition, daily thousands of advertisements are destined to an individual through different mind process of a person.

The public has always had an interesting relationship with mass media because it is the public that is breaths life into this organism called the mass media machine.

Mass Media And Technologies:
Back in the 18th century, it took very little effort to have fun. Simple games, such as hopscotch, jump rope and other activities made from natural materials brought laughter and happiness to families across the world. In the year of 2006, the definition of having fun has been digitally changed for teenagers. Mass media and new technologies are giving teens many ways to express themselves and to have fun, which of course, comes with a costly price. Media technologies have been changing throughout the past century, affecting not only the communication methods amongst teens, but also their social and psychological behaviour. With the help of newly invented cell phones, television which has oversaturated the world, as well as the seemingly omnipotent World Wide Web, teens are exposed to thing that they should not see. The excuse is that is it fun and entertaining. What most teens do no know, is that they are slowing creating a generation of people who are very dependent on technologies and "
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"This makes it possible for them to pursue large or expensive projects such as large-budget films, special investigative teams and in-depth coverage of key events. Actually, large-scale projects are also possible with network systems. They simply require cooperation and collaboration.

For example, some public domain software (free computer programs) is quite sophisticated and has been produced with the help of many people. In centralised systems, far-reaching decisions can be made by just a few people.In decentralised systems, greater participation is required. These four possible arguments for retaining mass media, in some reformed and improved form, actually turn out to be arguments against mass media. The mass media are not necessary for emergencies and are actually a key vulnerability to those who would take over a society.

The mass media are not necessary to enjoy and benefit from the talent of others. Power exercised through the mass media is unlikely to be a force for good since it tends to corrupt those who exercise it.Finally, although the mass media can undertake large projects, such projects can also develop through network media, but in a way involving participation rather than central direction. CONCLUSION: Thus the media’s the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that’s power. Because they control the minds of the masses.

Media enjoys a tremendous power in the modern world and its role in its dispensation of its duties largely remains admirable."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Researchers have conducted numerous studies over the years to examine the extent to which the mass media affects the political process.

While studies indicate that many voters get their information about upcoming elections and candidates from the media, research also indicate that the media may affect voter turnout as well. In addition, the media plays a tremendous role in the formation of public policy. Studies indicate that newspapers have a greater role in informing the electorate than do television news programs (Druckman 464).  Although voter turnout is also influenced by other factors, media projections continue to play a significant role in whether or not voters will go to the polls on Election Day (Crespin 1). Suggested solutions have been proposed to remedy the negative effect media projections tend to have on voter turnout; however, some of these solutions are criticized as potentially violating the First Amendment. Furthermore, media also has an important effect on policymaking because it serves as the primary conduit between those who wish to influence policy, and the policy-makers (Barker). In addition, the public receives much of its information about public policy through the media.Many studies have been conducted to determine whether newspapers have a direct influence on elections.

Surveys indicate that newspaper readers tend to know more about politics than do their counterparts who do not read newspapers. This finding is thought to be explained by the notion that newspapers generally offer qualitatively more and quantitatively better political coverage than one would find in television news. However, this notion has continually been met with research challenges. For example, in a well-known study on press coverage of Reagan, only small differences in the amount of policy coverage in newspapers and on television news shows were found. On the other hand, some scholars believe that though viewers may watch an increasing amount of television news, the increased viewing will not result in increased political knowledge. Others suggest that television news provides some political knowledge, but the knowledge conveyed is less than one would find in newspapers. Nevertheless, researchers conclude that regardless how small the differences in political coverage may be, the quantity, as well as the quality of newspaper coverage and readers’ ability to process the information will allow the reader to learn more about political issues the more he reads the newspaper (Druckman 464).

It is important to note that the newspaper is one of the older mediums through when political knowledge was passed. Many people still rely on newspapers as their way remaining aware of domestic and international politics. Because the newspaper is so old, many people trust newspaper content much more than they would trust television news. The higher degree of trust can also be attributed to the lesser emphasis newspapers place on entertainment value when compared to television news networks.Another important effect the media has on the political process is its influence on voter turnout on Election Day. Throughout the day when elections are held, news networks display maps and charts which use exit polling to reflect direction in which the election is heading."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Often times, television stations will use the results of the exit polls to call an election before the state polls have closed. In 1980, broadcasters declared that Ronald Reagan had won the election at approximately 8:15 pm EST. Although the polls in states along East Coast had already closed, polls in the West were open, and still had hours remaining before they would close. Early projections, like the one in the case of Reagan, sometimes rob late voters of the feeling of civic contribution. They are under the belief that the election has already been decided, and that their votes are no longer significant, therefore, casting the vote later in the day would be futile. Not only do early projections by the media have the effect of discouraging individual voters from casting ballots late on Election Day, but if enough voters are deterred by the projections, this effect could eliminate a group of voters which may have otherwise turned out to be critical to the outcome of the election if their ballots had been cast.

It is important to note that while most studies involving the effect the media has on voter turnout fail to consider other factors, discouraged voter turnout may result from other factors as well. Voter-specific variables such as age, race, income, and education factor into voter turnout as well. For example, voters who have obtained at least a high school diploma are more likely to vote on Election Day. Voters who have a higher income are also more likely to participate in elections.

Similarly, election-specific variables such as the bandwagon effect (in which voters do not initially intend to vote, but they cast their ballots for the leader at the last minute) and the underdog effect (which causes voters to decide at the last minute to vote for the candidate who is losing the election) also have significant effects on voter turnout. Crespin and Vander Wielen state that most prior studies on media projections and voter turnout omit voter-specific variables and election-specific variables and are consequently not as accurate as they could be (Crespin 5-9).One approach to solving the problem caused by early projections is expressed in the call for Congress to prohibit the media from broadcasting the projections. This proposed solution, however, is extremely unlikely because election projections are considered to be protected under the free speech clause of the First Amendment. Although Congress likely has a compelling interest in preventing the media from interfering with election results by broadcasting their projections, the counterargument is that election projections should not be considered as an interference if they are understood by the public as mere projections which are not necessarily based on the actual ballots that are cast. If, however, voters are actually being misled to think that projections actually indicate that a candidate has officially won the election, Congress may require that broadcasting companies include disclosures along with their projections. Other proposed solutions include a Congressional restriction on exit polling, which would make it more difficult for media broadcasters to gain the information that is necessary for their projections, and banning media presence at the ballot count. These solutions are also challengeable on the grounds of constitutionality (Cohen 1-5).

One of the most important media roles in politics is its influence on policymaking. Viewers learn about political issues by reading newspapers, watching television, and reading news from the internet. The media’s influence if far-reaching, as it affects foreign and domestic policy. Ways in which the media can influence domestic policymaking are by filtering issues and forming relationships with the policy-makers themselves (Barker).The media filters issues by determining which issues will be covered and which sources will be used, or by setting the policy agenda. For this reason, policy debates are usually confined to current issues which are set as topics by the major political parties. Information conveyed by the media is often concise."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"This is especially true of television news, which frequently uses sound bites to attract the attention of viewers and convey political messages. For this reason, outsider groups may find it difficult to voice their views in the media. These groups attempt to use the media to gain recognition as trusted policy actors, but they must often times use other resources due to the media’s reliance on long established sources for content.In the past, it was believed that the media influenced policy by operating separately from policy actors and conducting investigations.

The investigations would in return prompt the organization of citizens to create pressure on the government, which would eventually lead to political change. This model is referred to as the Mobilization Model. More recent studies examined the relationship between the media and policy actors. It was discovered that political change often occurs without regard to how the public reacts to investigative journalism. A study of the relationship between the media and political actors revealed that prepublication collaboration between the parties may be the actual cause of political change in some cases. In cases in which a politician had prior knowledge of negative press, he could use the negative press as an opportunity to promote new policy.

In other words, politicians who were actually causing problems were learning about investigations before they were broadcast to the public. Once the politicians had knowledge of the investigation, they would propose a new policy and ensure that they would be portrayed as part of the solution for the problem which they had originally created. This style of journalism in which journalists and politicians collaborate is known as “coalition journalism.” Both parties benefit from this type of journalism because journalists obtain credentialed information and recognition for providing important stories. Politicians, on the other hand, benefit by obtaining publicity for their agendas. Recent trends indicate that the adversarial style of journalism, in which policy-makers and journalists are not working together, is being replaced by coalition journalism.

Investigative journalism is becoming less visible to the public, and broadcasters are spending less time on producing long-term investigations that follow the policymaking process more closely. As a result, investigative journalism does not have the same degree of effect in bringing public awareness to policy issues as it has had in the past.Media corporations, like traditional policy actors, may also set policy agendas. As the amount of attention the policy receives decreases over time, the public will have less influence on the policy outcome, and it will be left in the hands of the politicians. As coalition journalism increases, the public has less and less influence on policy outcomes and the outcomes are increasingly left to the influence of the media and policy actors. Furthermore, the media may manipulate policy outcomes by convincing the public to take a certain position on an issue, thereby pressuring politicians to act in favor of the outcome that is desired by the public, although the push to support position actually comes from the media (Barker). This continuing trend toward the media and policy actors working together to bring political issues to the forefront of public interest diminishes the public’s interest in having an independent body inform them about political issues and investigate policy actors.Studies also indicate that the media has a role in shaping foreign policy."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"The process by which the media influences foreign policy is commonly referred to as the CNN effect. This effect occurs when global news networks determine political processes by selectively covering certain issues. An example of the power global news networks have in promoting foreign policy is evident in the case of U.S. intervention in Somalia. Before the media began to broadcast the case for humanitarian intervention, the U.S. government was trying to raise awareness for the issue through press releases.

The press releases were ineffective, however, because the media paid little attention to them. Once the media heard through and information leak that the U.S. government was planning to send troops to assist with a UN intervention in Somalia, broadcasters immediately began to call the intervention. The media began to frame their reporting to support the president’s position, and they only highlighted the positive aspects of intervening.

Furthermore, media coverage showed empathy for the people of Somalia. Despite the fact that the government has decided to intervene long before the issue received media coverage, the end result made it appear that the government had decided on the humanitarian intervention as a result of public outcry (Barker).Another example of the strong effect of the media is evident in the U.

S. intervention in Bosnia. Prior to Clinton’s inauguration, Bush (senior) has established that U.S. policy would focus on Somalia and the Gulf states, and that the U.

S. would not be involved in the developments in Yugoslavia. However, during the Clinton presidential campaign, Clinton expressed greater interest in involvement with the Bosnian conflict.

At the start of Clinton’s first term, the media had already begun to concentrate its coverage on the Balkans, and the media had already begun to address the issue of involvement in the Balkan war. Although the Clinton administration had begun to express uncertainty about the Balkans, the media increased public pressure to address the issue by focusing its content on the region (Barker).Still other researchers claim that the media serves to stimulate political transparency. Otherwise stated, the media encourages openness and democratic accountability in the political process, thereby strengthening the connection between government and the people. Political transparency can be divided into three classifications. The first type is informational transparency, which is knowledge about government actors, government decisions, and government information.

Informational transparency can be furthered by requiring disclosure of reasons for government actions and information the government has collected. The second type of transparency is participatory transparency, which is the ability to participate in political decisions either through fair representation or direct participation. The third type of transparency is accountability transparency, which is the ability to hold government actors accountable when they break the law or do something that affects the interests of the public. Mass media can enhance all three types of transparency by helping people understand government, participate in the political process, and hold government actors accountable (Balkin). Although political transparency is often assisted by the media, the media can also be used to decrease political transparency when policy actors and media companies shape and influence the information the public receives from media outlets. The dominant medium of political communication is television. This can potentially be dangerous for the political process because entertainment is greatly valued in this medium.

Because entertainment is so greatly valued, coverage of politics, law, and related events are pressured to conform to the standards of “good television,” which means that the coverage must primarily grab the viewer’s attention. Television coverage tends to focus less on substantive policy issues and more on the means by which political advantage and viability are secured. Coverage that focuses on the celebrity of political participants and the sporting element of politics is greatly encouraged (Balkin). As previously discussed, the great emphasis television broadcasters place on entertainment value leads many people to believe that television news is a less reliable medium. Often times, stories are sensationalized, flashy graphics are added, and sound bites are generated."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Television news networks often place less value on providing a large variety of through information, while they focus more on gaining the attention of potential viewers.Media events are also ways by which political transparency is manipulated. Politicians stage events, such as press conferences and political rallies to be covered by the media. Some media events are designed to look governmental, as they show leaders engaged in carrying out the business of governing. Others are designed to show candid, personal moments of the politician’s life. These may include coverage of the candidate interacting with his family, or other moments of intimacy. While the purpose of media events is to aid in achieving the goal of transparency by encouraging the public to watch and witness effective governance and candor, staged media events frustrate this objective.

Instead of offering the viewers candor and a look into effective governance, media events often offer a view of a constructed political image and showmanship (Balkin).In general, ways in which the media influences voting are by affecting voter turnout through early election projections and by informing voters about upcoming elections and candidates. It is important to note that while media projections have an important effect on voter turnout, other voter-specific and election-specific determinants factor into whether or not certain voters will report to the polls. While some studies indicate that newspapers provide more political content—both qualitatively and quantitatively—other studies disagree with this finding. Nevertheless, most studies agree that the degree to which newspaper and television news programs provide viewers and readers with political knowledge is significant.

International news networks have a dramatic effect on foreign policy in the U.S., as illustrated by the case of the humanitarian intervention in Somalia.

Once the larger news networks like CNN focus on an issue, the increased media focus usually results in increased public awareness and sometimes serves to rally citizens in favor taking a certain stance. The media also has an influence on policymaking because it in many cases serves as a vehicle by which policy actors and members of the mass media work together to present policy issues to the public. At one point, the media and policy actors were adversarial, and journalists brought public attention to issues through investigative journalism. Now, there is a continuing trend toward a more symbiotic relationship between the media and policy actors. The media also has an influence on policymaking by simulating transparency.

Through various media outlets, constituents are able to become informed about politics, participate in political processes, and hold politicians accountable for their actions. Although the media serves to enhance transparency in some cases, transparency may be inhibited by practices, such as staging media events which merely portray the image that politicians want the public to see. This practice is in direct opposition to the notion of using the media to give the public a view of governance and the political character of the leaders they elect.Works CitedBalkin, J. “How Mass Media Simulate Political Transparency.” Retrieved March 29,2007, from http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/articles/media01."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Journalists who hold views consistent with their interests raise the issue of media bias.

In a technical sense, no one is completely unbiased. Psychologists remind us that people must learn to distinguish reality, and how they learn affects what they see. In a practical sense, however, we can all agree that there is such a thing as intent reality and can agree on what it is. The divergence comes when facts are ambiguous or must be interpreted and when deciding what is interesting and what is not. Journalists, unlike scientists, do not proof observations under controlled conditions. They do not have the luxury of formative the variables (time, place, subject, duration) of the events they cover. They cannot imitate the conditions under which the events occurred. The events concerning which journalists must report are not as well defined as those observed by scientists. The freezing temperature of water is highly definable; the effects of a new foreign policy on the balance of trade, a court decision concerning abortions of teenage pregnancies, or a bitter labor wallop on a community are not.

Unlike the stony physical properties of objects scientists observe, journalists monitor the volatile and erratic human animal.There’s no meter that one can objectively view to measure degrees of propriety in political office, rightness of social or economic policies, nobility of a war, truthfulness in corporate news releases, or a million other things.David Brinkley, veteran broadcast journalist, argues that a computer can objectively record information, but a reporter can’t.If you put something in [the computer] and push the button you get back precisely what you put in, with no coloring, shading, changing or anything. To put the same requirement on a news broadcaster or any human being could mean that he was not in favor of anything or opposed to anything, didn’t believe in anything, did not reject anything, had no standards, no values–and therefore, I think, would probably be dangerous to society and probably should be locked up. (“The view from the trenches,” Broadcasting, Nov. 15, 1982, 96)Although studies of the media provide contingent evidence supporting the case for media bias, none has methodically established that case.

The attitudes of journalists can lead to biased reporting; and different other studies, such as those sponsored by the Media Institute, have shown that the media do not present a reasonable view on particular issues. However, there has been very little direct proof linking the attitudes of journalists with the imperatives of the medium to methodically explain media bias. Without this information, all that is probable is informed speculation.Given the political and economic views of journalists, it would be unusual if news coverage were not extremely critical of business. Now this does not mean that journalists are consciously more critical of business or business executives than other institutions or individuals. It is more that there is a fundamental presumption against business. Business executives have an extra burden of proof to establish the purity of their motives and the uniformity of their interests with that of the public’s."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"In addition to what may be called the ideological bias in news reporting, there is a bias linked with the medium in which the news is presented.All news presented in the mass media of communication newspapers, television, radio–must be presented in such a way as to draw an audience. Network news, in part because of the forceful competition between networks for viewers, has become as much entertainment as news; but in all the media there is an effort to amuse by pointing out the unusual, the unpredicted, and the shocking. News must be presented in such a way that it will attract the concentration of the average person who is uninformed and has no prior interest in the topic.

Thus, the medium focuses news reporting not just on the most important events but regularly on the most dramatic events, regardless of their importance. This explains why bad news is so often featured over good news and why the less interesting or more complex stories are avoided.In an important article, “The Media and Business Elites” appearing in Public Opinion, S. Robert Lichter and Stanley Rothman help explain the origins of press bias. The politics of the “media elite,” Lichter and Rothman demonstrate, is predominately liberal, as indicated by their political self-identification (54 percent left of center), voting record (overwhelmingly Democratic), and attitudes on social issues (favor redistribution for the disadvantaged, quality-of-life orientation).Research on the role of media coverage in congressional elections has been really influenced by the notion that representatives seek coverage to ease reelection. Parker (1981) argues that wakefulness is the key to congressional candidate success, and the media are the leading mechanism by which to attain mass awareness.

Payne (1980) believes that insecure members of Congress are more likely to seek publicity, apparently to help their reelection efforts. Goidel and Shields (1994) illustrate the positive relationship between component media use and support for incumbents. Goidel and Shields conclude that media revelation tends to bias voters toward incumbents. What all these studies (and a substantial number of others) have in common is a foundation on the assertion that media coverage is intrinsically beneficial.

Toward that end, Maisel recounts the conclusion of numerous congressional challengers he interviewed: “newspaper coverage” that persistently mentioned the incumbent “was the hardest part of running” as a challenger (1982, 117).Alternatively, several have come to the direct opposite conclusion, that is, more media attention can be detrimental to incumbent health (Niven and Zilber 1998). Specifically, national media attention has been associated to decreases in incumbent popularity in the 1990s. Given the advantage in campaign spending that an incumbent typically has (and the attendant television ads and direct mail pieces those dollars buy), less media coverage in fact translates into greater control for the member over the images seen.

Using a measure of national prominence, based on media attention gathered by all incumbents running for reelection in 1990-1996, revealed that heavy national coverage translated into a loss of support of up to eight points for the most profoundly covered members of the House of Representatives.Some researchers believe that the extent of effect the media have varies extremely by the attributes of the observer. Specifically, many who study racial politics believe that the political perspectives of African Americans will lead them to have a quite discrete reaction to media coverage (Davis and Gandy 1999)."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"African American voters are in a unique position of perceiving the significance of government in providing for their needs, while concurrently feeling a general distrust for a government run by, and potentially for, whites (Swain 1995). Scholars have argued that as African Americans attempt to find outlets to prevent being overwhelmed by white influences and power, their efforts can produce vastly diverse perspectives on politics  This fear of being overwhelmed is evident in Sigelman and Welch ( 1991, 52-53) findings, for example, that 82% of African Americans believe there is at least a “fair amount” of white prejudice against them and that 25% of African Americans believe a majority of whites accept the racial views of the KKK. Sigelman and Welch conclude, “It is clear that blacks see racial discrimination as an everyday incidence, not an historical curiosity” (1991, 59).Meanwhile, a considerable majority of African Americans believe that the government is not doing enough to make certain equality (Sigelman and Welch 1991, 138).

Toward that end, where they are a politically pertinent force, members of minority communities can be anticipated to practice “racially conscious politics” as part of an effort to assert their groups’ position. This forms a special relationship between minority voters and minority representatives. Kleppner argues that African American candidates can be seen by African American voters as a “means of political liberation” (1985, 154).

Minority representation facilitates feeling not simply protected but also valued as a community.This desire for representation among African Americans can create intense devotion. Swain quotes one African American member of the House as saying, “One of the advantages and disadvantages of representing blacks is their unabashed loyalty to their incumbents. You can almost get away with raping babies and be forgiven. You don’t have any vigilance concerning your performance” (1995, 73).Bobo and Gilliam (1993) argue that racially cognizant politics emerge in minority communities with high political empowerment.

Empowerment is significant, they theorize, because it increases levels of political belief, political efficacy, and the desire for political knowledge. Bobo and Gilliam, certainly, find higher levels of empowerment (which produces citizens who are more engaged in politics and more well-informed about government) where African American voters are represented by African American officials.Given this line of thinking, a number of studies have recommended that African Americans will feel empowered by, and react completely to, coverage of African American representatives, while having much less obligation to white representatives and no positive reaction to coverage of white representatives.Moreover, the media’s influence in American politics has almost certainly been on the rise all through the past two decades.

Cable television now offers the average American a diversity of programming options from which to choose, including round-the-clock coverage from stations devoted completely to news. With the rise of several new communication technologies, most particularly the Internet, the reach of mass media has been increased further still.While the Web is undoubtedly a developing medium for congressional offices, its significance as an outlet for members’ communication goals should not be ignored. Representative Edolphus Towns (D-NY) refers to his Web site as “a vehicle of empowerment for all.” Charles Rangel (D-NY), in his welcome message on his Web site, explains, “I have established this Web page with the needs of my constituents in mind.

It will provide faster access to information on my activities in the U.S. House of Representatives and in my Congressional District.

. . . I encourage you to use this site as yet another way to let your voices be heard.”"
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Moreover, 97% of House offices have Web sites; House Web sites receive as many as 1,000 visits per month and Web sites tend to mark substantially similar content as the traditional congressional newsletters that are sent to all constituents. By 1998 the expectation that representatives would have Web and e-mail systems up and running was strong enough that several newspapers featured stories on members who did not have computer communication systems. The Seattle Times quoted one voter as asking the paper to do a story on those members of Congress “who don’t bother to get with the times and get e-mail.” (Seattle Times, December 17, 1998). Finally, Web sites are measured significant enough that, just as franking privileges are balanced throughout the two months preceding an election, House members are not allowed to update their Web sites during the two months prior to an election.All member Web sites have a biography page that presents the representatives’ background information and, to varying degrees, their political agenda. almost all the Web sites set off the biography with a separate page discussing the member’s issue agenda (which vary from including as few as 1 issue to as many as 30), and most offer recent press releases in their sites.

Finally, a number of members highlight an issue or two with special links and separate pages dedicated just to that issue. Characteristically, in addition to member-created material, sites offer a number of nonpolitical links, such as to the representative’s home area, and a number of links to political, but not member-specific, information such as the congressional calendar, the Library of Congress, and the congressional legislative bill tracking service.Though, concurrent with the onslaught of new media outlets has been an evenly important decline in customary socializing forces. Political parties, once dominant in most voters’ decision-making equations, have for a number of reasons seen their influence steadily decay as their heyday in the 1930s and 1940s. Parents, too, have begun to play a reduced role in shaping children’s political opinions and activities (Kahan 1999). In the absence of strong supervision from these two traditional agents of socialization, Americans — especially young Americans — are arguably more vulnerable to media images today than at any time in our history (Kahan 1999).Influential media are not in and of themselves a problem, but they become a problem as the information presented is deceptive or fails to precisely reflect reality.

While we cherish our First Amendment right to a free press, we must be equally vigilant in guarding against its abuse. Errors of fact or judgment are vault to happen from time to time, but a methodical pattern of deception or misrepresentation is potentially quite harmful. Almost by definition a democracy requires well-informed voters, and our citizenry can expect to be only as informed as the information it receives.Numerous recent opinion polls have shown that a majority of Americans disapprove of the way their news is accessible and distrust the mass media as an institution. One might as a result be tempted to assume that most Americans are selective consumers of news, continually on guard for potentially false or misleading information.

In reality, though, it would be hard for even the most cynical among us to spot anything but the most blatant cases of reporter bias. Common sense dictates that the average American sitting at home watching the nightly news or reading the local newspaper will have a hard time discerning whether any given story is slanted, badly researched, or unrepresentative.Additionally, news consumers could barely be considered a captive audience.

With so many news outlets from which to choose, we obviously tend to gravitate toward the sources we believe most trustworthy. Thus, while Americans may mistrust the media as an institution, they are apt to assume that the majority of the news they personally receive will be a moderately accurate representation of reality all the more reason to believe that a systematic prototype of faulty news reporting is likely to produce erroneous public judgments on a diversity of topics.Congressional Web sites on the Internet provide enthusiastic insight into members’ interests and priorities. By analyzing these sites, we are capable to discern that, in general, African American members do not effort to portray themselves in a different light than white members.

In an effort to observe congressional communication autonomously of what the press secretaries say it is, we turn to the Internet Web sites for members of Congress. Web sites provide access to cosmic quantities of congressional communication, including information geared particularly for the voters and information targeted for the media, providing a third party the chance to see if African American members are in any way supporting the media’s race-centered view of their work.Though, the attitudes of the media toward the economy and business that this study reveals are mainly interesting. On the one hand, the media elite support capitalism: they do not favor nationalization of large companies; they favor less regulation of business and support discrepancy economic reward based on merit. On the other hand, they remain intensely critical of business because they believe that business leaders have more power than they deserve. Media elites believe that business is the most prominent group in society but that the media ought to be. Thus, media appreciation of business appears to be based on their belief that business is the main leadership group with who they are in contention for power. To an indefinite degree this bias affects public opinion and is translated into public policy.

Efforts to correct press bias will be pointless as long as reporters persist in their ideological contentment. Unlike their European colleagues, American journalists usually value political neutrality or “objectivity,” and most reporters believe that their primary accountability is to report the “facts.” Although recognizing the possibility of ideological distortion in others, they deny it in themselves. Stephen Hess, in The Washington Reporters, asked a sample of Washington-based journalists if they thought there was any press bias. A majority responded yes, and of those respondents almost all said the bias was left or liberal.

When Hess asked them about their own politics, most said they were moderate or middle-of-the-road. Lichter and Rothman also found that members of the press tend to judge their colleagues as more liberal. This reveals that reporters are indeed middle-of-the-road or that they misperceive the politics of their colleagues, but that individually they feel they are politically neutral or unbiased.Rothman and Lichter found that the journalism students are significantly more liberal and critical of business than business executives (Stanley Rothman and S. Robert Lichter, 1983). The conclusion drawn from these and similar observations is that education is undermining the business system, first, by producing nonbusiness professionals and managers such as journalists who are very vital of business, and, second, by producing business executives who are not entrusted to the values of the institutions that employ them.This view leads to astounding ideological satisfaction, as revealed unwittingly by MacDougall. Though an excellent case can be made that a significant affliction of Americans in general and American business in particular is a lack of self-assurance, the opposite should be said of the American news media.

Much news reporting is completely inadequate and misleading and reflects the liberal, anti business beliefs of reporters–to the detriment of the public and public policy. This shortcoming will not be corrected until those who form the news undertake serious self-criticism.References:·         “The view from the trenches,” Broadcasting, Nov. 15, 1982, 96·         Bobo Lawrence and Franklin Gilliam. 1993.

,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Media has the power to strengthen the changes in our social, cultural, and political values. The improvement of media has increased the spread of ideas and has made communication more convenient. Television, Facebook, and Twitter are all considered mass medias because they provide people with entertainment, and it is where the flow of ideas is disseminated. In James Fallows essay, “Win in China!” he states that media encourages the Chinese to follow their dreams, such as becoming an entrepreneur. Through television, people are able to see real life activism take place, which encourages them to coin the definition of success. Media is motivating the Chinese people to try and improve their lives by shying away from their traditional government-controlled values. Malcolm Gladwell problematizes Fallows’ views in his essay “Small Change: Why The Revolution Will Not Be Tweeted.” He argues that because media is commercially available to everyone, they often abuse it, leading them to forget the values of motivation while becoming too self-absorbed. Gladwell thinks that media is lessening the motivation of many American to participate in social and political engagements. Media promotes new ideas by spreading it to every individual in order to motivate them to further amplify their social and cultural values.           The advancement of media provides individuals with a chance to form new ideas by allowing them to share their thoughts. Television, Facebook, and Twitter helps people generate their ideas in order to motivate others. Wang Lifen, the producer and on-camera host of the game show Win in China in Fallows’ essay claims, “[w]e want to teach values. Our dream for the show is to enlighten Chinese people and help them realize their own dreams” (Fallows 102).

People can get lots of information about the whole universe without doing any efforts. Since media has a great impact on us we can say that we can face many problems without it. As far as concerned with the education and media has a good impact on us. People can get much information about each country which is related with history, culture, geography and social lives.
Nowadays, people are getting tons of information in few seconds by different means of media. It has given lots of political, economical and scientific awareness to the people. According to the educational point of view, media has imparted great efforts towards formal and technical education. It makes study easy for the students to learn and understand their courses by online lectures and presentations and articles.
It has relatively decreased the barriers between the nations regarding social and cultural values. Media has served in entertainment world also which includes music, dramas, historical shows, sports and so on. Some analysts also regard media as a lethal weapon which has the capability to perform it for evil as well as good purposes."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"nstead of the media being biased, the editorial asserts, perhaps it’s time to consider reader and viewer bias. “We remain a red and blue nation,” the editorial points out, adding that media outlets, driven by economics, may have to cater to audiences’ political preferences and return to the time of the partisan press when readers knew before they picked up their paper in the morning what the writers’ opinions would be (“Red News”).Claims of media bias pervade the airwaves. Fox News often takes a right-of center stance in reporting the news but claims that it is justified in calling itself “Fair and Balanced” because of what it describes as a tendency for the rest of the mainstream news media to lean to the left (Collins & Hickey).  Mainstream news outlets take a beating every week on radio talk shows hosted by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly, who accuse the news outlets of having a left-of-center political agenda.
Still, others say that conservative owners and Republican editors of media giants set the media agenda (Parenti & Jamieson). Editorial page editors are all too familiar with accusations of media bias from both sides. Schmitt and colleagues point out a common problem for newspaper editors. “Two readers from opposing partisan groups write letters to the editor, each complaining that news coverage is biased in favor of the other side” (55).Many of those looking to back up their claims of media bias point to a 1996 Freedom Forum/Roper Center survey as evidence that the news media lean one way or the other. The survey found that out of 139 Washington-based journalists surveyed, 61 percent of the sample identified themselves as “liberal” or “liberal to moderate.” Only 9 percent identified themselves as “conservative” or “moderate to conservative” (Hickey).

The book The American Journalist reported in 1996 that 44 percent of journalists lean toward the Democratic Party while 16 percent prefer Republicans and 16 percent prefer independents (Dennis). In his best-selling book Bias, journalist Bernard Goldberg lays out a number of studies that show journalists lean toward the left and contends journalists as a group are generally out-of-sync with “mainstream America” (127).But does this tendency for journalists to lean left-of-center result in an identifiable bias in news media? A sampling of content analyses show it does not. A study done analyzing news coverage during the presidential campaigns of 1988, 1992, and 1996 found that on the whole, campaign coverage of the Democratic and Republican candidates was evenly balanced in two of the three elections — the one aberration was in the 1992 campaign: Bill Clinton was found to receive 54.4 percent of positive coverage in his race against George H.W.

A study analyzing news coverage of the 1991 House banking scandal, in which members had written more than 8,000 checks resulting in insufficient funds in their House bank accounts, found that coverage was evenly balanced between Democrats and Republicans, showing no evidence to support claims of “anti-Republican bias or any meaningful partisan bias” (Niven 648).As researchers continue to undertake content analyses in response to media bias claims, another body of research is ongoing. This research is looking at audience perceptions and asking what consumers of news and information bring to the table when it comes to seeing a news story as biased. Could the news stories some readers and viewers deem biased actually be measured as fair and objective by other readers and viewers? Could it be that audience members’ preconceived notions are responsible for the way they judge stories, and not the stories themselves? Though the answer is not that simple, previous research suggests individuals’ preconceived notions do play a big role in how they judge the fairness and objectivity of a news story.This study expands on that body of research, looking at audience perception of media bias and the hostile media effect, which Vallone and colleagues first described in 1985 as the tendency of partisans on both sides of an issue to see new coverage as biased against their point of view.

Since Vallone and colleagues’ coinage of the term, many researchers have sought to replicate the hostile media effect, and many have been successful, finding that two viewers diametrically opposed to each other on an issue covered in the news will find the same story biased against their point of view. Issues covered in these studies have included the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict (Vallone et al.), the use of primates in research (Gunther et al.

), and the use of genetically modified foods (Schmitt et al.).This study attempts to replicate the hostile media effect by looking at how those who support and oppose the war in Iraq see a news story related to the war. It attempts to expand on the knowledge of the hostile media effect by seeing if it is strong enough to drive readers and viewers to other sources they see as friendly to their point of view.Why is it important to better understand the hostile media effect and its implications? Schmitt and colleagues put it this way: “…if people do subject information to different cognitive and perceptual processing when it appears in mass media, understanding this processing may provide us with important clues to the singular role of mass media as an information source in society” (55).It is important to study this effect and understand what impact it will have in a society that is growing more segmented when it comes to media consumption. Evidence shows that audiences are becoming more fragmented based on political beliefs and other characteristics."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Mainstream media outlets are losing viewers and listeners to new media sources, including cable television programming, Internet Web sites, chat rooms, and talk radio. Jones states “For any given new media program, members of the audience are more likely to share common interests and political views” (159).Looking at the hostile media effect and the role it plays in selection of news sources sets the stage for answering further important questions: How will getting news and information from a source that presents it in a light friendly to one’s political outlook affect their knowledge on issues? How will it affect political discourse and one’s willingness to engage in discussions with those who share differing views? How will citizens get critical information about elected officials and issues when media outlets serve as an extension of the political party and promote one side of the debate while discrediting the other? Review of LiteratureTrends in media consumptionIn 1996, Australian Rupert Murdoch launched Fox News in an attempt to be a major player in American television (Hickey). Nine years after its launch, Fox’s opinion-based format with a host of news personalities who boast mostly right of center views has helped the network eclipse the viewership of CNN and drawn people away from network news to cable (Pew). Fox continues to climb ahead of CNN in the Nielsen ratings. On election night 2004, Fox drew 8.1 million viewers compared to CNN’s 6.2 million viewers.

Fox beat even the broadcast networks in viewership during the Republican convention in September 2004 (Berkowitz).Results from a 2004 Pew Research Center for the People and the Press survey show that since 2000, the number of Americans who watch Fox News has increased from 17 percent to 25 percent (Pew). Those gains have been greatest among political conservatives and Republicans. Fifty-two (52) percent of Fox viewersdescribe themselves as conservative, up from 40 percent when the survey was taken in 2000. While Republicans and political conservatives are coming to Fox in larger numbers, they are also shunning other news sources. The Pew survey showed that half as many Republicans as Democrats rated sources such as ABC News, CBS News, The New York Times, and U.S. News and World Report as credible.

The partisan divide isn’t present only in Fox viewers. The gap between the percentage of Republicans and Democrats who listen to talk radio is also growing, according to the Pew study. It defines talk radio as shows that invite viewers to discuss current events, public issues and politics and includes examples such as Rush Limbaugh’s show and call-in shows on National Public Radio.

In 2004, 24 percent of Republicans regularly listened to radio shows that invite discussion of current events and politics. Only 13 percent of Democrats listened to these shows. In 2002, 21 percent of Republicans listened to talk radio versus 16 percent for Democrats.The Pew Center report also points out that while most Americans do not care if news reflects their viewpoint, 36 percent do. Thirty-three (33) percent of those who identified themselves as liberal reported liking news that shares their point of view.

  The report says liberals go to sources such as Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” and National Public Radio to get news and information. Forty-three (43) percent of conservatives reported liking their news to share their point of view and 41 percent of Republicans go to Fox News to get news that coincides with that view. Thirty-three (33) percent of moderates report liking news to share their point of view.Evidence points to a growing trend: Political partisans sense a growing presence of bias in mainstream news. This perception of bias leads them to seek out news programming and publications that square with the views they hold.

The success of opinion-based programming shows that when given a choice, partisans will often abandon other news sources and stick with those they feel present the news in the light they most want to see it. The rise of cable and the Internet has given readers and viewers unprecedented choice in deciding where they want to get their news and information. This level of choice threatens to fragment audiences in new ways.It is important to look at what drives the perception of bias, particularly among partisans. As the Pew Center data show, media bias is driving viewers and readers — particularly Republicans —to other specific sources of news and information that they and like-minded news consumers deem friendlier to their views. Building a theoretical framework: The hostile media effect Vallone and colleagues were the first to coin the phrase “hostile media phenomenon” to describe “the tendency for partisans (defined in this case as those who share opposing views on an issue) to view media coverage of controversial events as unfairly biased and hostile to the position they advocate” (Discussion section 1). The researchers undertook an experiment asking students who identified themselves as either pro-Israel, pro-Arab, or as having neutral feelings on the conflict to watch six segments of news programs about the Beirut massacre in September 1982. When it came to the pro-Israeli and pro-Arab students, each side found the news segments as biased in favor of the other side."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"Further, the researchers found that the perception of bias led those on both sides to believe that personal views of the editorial staffs who produced the segments were opposite of their own when it came to the subject. Vallone and colleagues also noted that within both groups, those with the highest amount of knowledge were more likely to identify the media as biased. In their study, the researchers wrote, “Our suggestion is that viewers of media coverage of a continuing political struggle may see their side portrayed as villain, and the other side as the hero” (Media Coverage section 4). They came up with three possible explanations of why those who claimed media bias did. The first was that partisans would observe a story as devoting an equal amount of facts and time to both sides, but because partisans believed their side’s claims to be more accurate than the other, even balanced coverage would be seen as biased. Giner-Sorolla and Chaiken explain this in a later study, saying “Thus, even a correctly perceived balanced presentation would appear to be unfairly biased toward the opposition, by treating the ‘inferior’ claims of the opposition as equivalent to the ‘superior’ claims of the partisan’s own side” (166).

The second explanation was that individuals recall the same images and arguments in a news report, but they are likely to classify those images and argumentsas hostile to their own side. Even neutral material is likely to be rejected, so that thevalence of images and arguments are seen as supporting the other side. Giner-Sorolla and Chaiken call this “selective categorization.

” The third explanation was that partisans remember the facts and images that went against their beliefs better than they remembered the material that coincided with their beliefs. Giner-Sorolla and Chaiken call this “selective recall.”Seeking to further understand how processes contributing to the hostile media effect work, Giner-Sorolla and Chaiken undertook additional experiments to see if news stories on developments in the Middle East and abortion prompted thesame reaction among partisans. They were able to replicate the hostile media effect among a group of students on the Middle East issue, but not on the abortion issue. The two found through their experiment that selective recall and selective categorization did not explain the hostile media effect, but that “prior beliefs about media bias were the main ingredient on bias judgment, affecting viewers of the program both directly and through estimates of program content” (Giner-Sorolla & Chaiken 179).Gunther built on the work of Vallone and colleagues by looking more closely at who was vulnerable to the hostile media effect. After analyzing data from a study commissioned by the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE), he found that if a person identified with a particular group, he or she was more likely to say media coverage of that group was unfavorable.

While Republicans judged coverage of their own group as “not favorable enough,” Democrats found coverage of Republicans “too favorable.” Gunther concluded that high involvement in an issue “increases the likelihood that a person will take a skeptical view of the source of that content” (161). Those likely to have polarized attitudes about certain issues are those who have a sense of involvement with a group that is associated with an “enduring” sense of self. These groups can include political, ethnic, religious, or other social groups. Those who identified themselves with particular groups were much more likely to say the media gave unfair coverage of that particular group.Gunther’s research gives merit to what Joseph Klapper wrote in Public Opinion Quarterly in 1957.

In looking at the effect media had on a listener or viewer, Klapper called mass media a contributory agent in a process of reinforcement — or that the media were more likely to reinforce pre-existing beliefs than to change them. Klapper discussed the power of group membership when it comes to mediating information from media, and he said that communications that were opposed to the norms of a group an audience member belonged to would be rejected, especially if the audience member highly valued his or her group membership.Thus, he says, “The typical audience member selects from the media’s varied fare those commodities which are in accord with his existing likes, and typically eschews exposure to other kinds of material” (Klapper 467). He went on to say that the audience member’s likes stem from his reference groups. Perloff alludes to this as well in one of his studies, saying that when individuals are strongly committed to a position, “they assimilate or find support in evidence and information other people regard as ambiguous, inconclusive, and problem ridden” (238).

Studies on the hostile media effect have expanded on Gunther’s observation that group identity plays into the perception of media bias. Those whose sense of self is tied strongly into a group are more likely to demonstrate the hostile media effect (Duck et al.).

Matheson built on this research with an experiment that asked Bosnian Serbs and Muslim partisans and a neutral group to respond to the coverage of the 1994 Sarajevo market bombing. Matheson found that “partisans’ perceptions of who is the villain and who is the victim stem from the motivation to distinguish between the in-group and out-group in such a way as to reinforce a positive and distinct in-group identity” (Matheson 123).After the seminal studies on the hostile media effect were published, Gunther and colleagues investigated the larger effect of the phenomenon when it came to partisans estimating larger public opinion. Christen, Kannaovakun and Gunther stated that “hostile media perceptions are important only to the extent that they result in related attitude or behavior outcomes…” (425). Looking at the 1997 United Parcel Service strike, the researchers sought to find out whether groups on both sides of the strike — UPS workers and Teamsters — would exhibit the hostile media effect and if they did, how it would affect their perceptions of public opinion.They predicted it could go in two directions. First, partisans who found media to be hostile to their point of view could perceive public opinion to follow the mediac overage they believed others were being exposed to (the persuasive press inference).

Or, those who perceived media coverage to be biased could perceive public opinion to be a reflection of their own views (projection). The hostile media effect was replicated, with both the UPS and Teamster partisans seeing news coverage as biased against their own groups. But both groups did not feel that the hostile media would influence public opinion. Instead, both groups perceived public opinion to be a reflection of their own views (Christen et al.).Thus, it seems that this study adds fuel to the fire of those making claims of media bias. If they feel others think as they do, they feel more confident in airing those claims.

Schmitt and colleagues write about the power of partisan opinions. “Their viewpoints can powerfully influence public opinion and public policy; they are the ones who campaign and lobby, who demonstrate, parade and picket, who promote their viewpoint in countless ways…” (623-624). Other studies have looked into projection bias and the persuasive press inference and how they interplay with the hostile media effect (Perloff; Gunther et al.; Gunther & Christen).Recent studies have looked at how sources affect the perception of bias in partisans. Arpan and Raney carried out a study to find out whether news source resulted in the hostile media effect in partisans. They asked research subjects to read a story about their hometown college football team in one of three newspapers: the hometown newspaper, the newspaper covering the city of a rival team and a newspaper from a neutral town. The hostile media effect was replicated, with fans perceiving the article in all three newspapers as more biased against the home team than the rival team.

The researchers also found that participants rated the story as less biased against their team when it was printed in the hometown newspaper than when it was printed in the rival-town or neutral-town newspapers.  Schmitt and colleagues found that partisans who read information about genetically modified foods in a newspaper story found the information to be disagreeably biased. But the hostile media effect disappeared when the identical information was presented to partisans in the form of a college student’s essay.Factors influencing audience perceptionWatts and colleagues write that it is “primarily citizens’ partisan views that color perceptions of media fairness rather than assessments of actual bias” (147).

But they acknowledge there are other factors at work when it comes to a reader, viewer, or listener coming up with an assessment that a story is biased. Along with their preconceived notions, external factors contribute to the notion that the media could be “hostile” to a partisan’s point of view.One group to blame is the media itself, Watts and colleagues said. They said there is a new focus by journalists, candidates, and political pundits to look at the role the news media play in elections. This has led to increased coverage of news programs and journalists themselves, something the researchers refer to as “self coverage.

” A study of such coverage found it focuses overwhelmingly on the alleged presence of a left-leaning bias. Watts and colleagues concluded: “These results, then, suggest that the rising public perception of a liberal news media may have more to do with news self-coverage than with biases in valence news content” (Watts et al. 159). They point out that the rise in media self-coverage is proportional to the increase in the number of media outlets in the past 15 years.Another factor that Watts and colleagues studied was the public’s taking cues from conservative elites who allege a liberal media bias, perpetuating a notion that mainstream news channels use various techniques to advance a left-leaning agenda.

They cite poll data that shows an increase in complaints by the public during the 1988, 1992, and 1996 presidential campaigns that news coverage in general was biased in favor of Democrats. The percentage of the public claiming the press treated the Republican candidate unfairly increased 13 percent during the 1988 campaign, 22 percent during the 1992 campaign, and 9 percent during the 1996 campaign. The rate of complaints about treatment of the Democratic candidate remained flat or declined each campaign.

Watts and colleagues say studies of news coverage don’t support claims that Democrats were treated better in the press than Republicans. Rather, they say the decision that the press is liberal often results from readers and viewers taking cues from others. Because people don’t have time to pay attention to and absorb all the political news coverage that exists, they look for shortcuts. They turn to figures who, in their mind, are trustworthy to take information from and form opinions. Thus, when candidates, talk show hosts, and other conservatives lodge accusations of a liberal media bias, members of the public taking cues from them are likely to adopt similar attitudes.

Watts and colleagues write, “For conservative elites, in particular, phrases such as ‘the liberal media’ and ‘the media elite’ have become embedded in contemporary political culture and may possess considerable rhetorical weight. Liberal elites, in contrast, do not seem to have a comparable phrase” (151).The results support the findings of Giner-Sorolla and Chaiken, who said that the hostile media effect could lead a partisan to declare a news broadcast to be biased even before he saw it by applying his prior beliefs about a media outlet. Giner-Sorolla and Chaiken say: “Thus, partisans may have accepted the contention of fellow sympathizers that the mainstream media are biased” (167).In another study built on these findings, Watts and colleagues sought to find out whether conservative elites’ claims of liberal media bias came during periods when their candidates were subject to more negative press or when they were behind in the polls. The researchers found that claims of liberal bias in the news were more likely to come about when Republican candidates were receiving positive coverage and were ahead in the polls.

They suggested that the use of the liberal media accusation occurs more frequently when Republicans are able to exert more control over their message. They say this proves that complaints about news coverage are strategic to a certain point. In other words, conservatives lodge accusations that aren’t based in fact in order to exert control over a media message they have no control over.D’Alessio furthered the contention that cues are powerful in developing perceptions of media bias. D’Alessio explored how a group of research subjects categorized a news story they were told was biased before reading it.

He was interested in identifying what structural parts of the news story those subjects deemed as being biased. Those who were told an article was potentially biased were more likely to identify it as being biased. Those who were not cued were more likely to say their article was free from bias.D’Alessio asked subjects to circle the parts of the news story they claimed contained bias and then rate the article as biased or free from bias. Though participants who were given a cue that the article was biased were more likely to use that term to describe the story, they didn’t mark more statements as biased. Thus, D’Alessio concluded that perception of bias is related to charges of bias, not actual bias, supporting the research of Watts and colleagues.

“Together, their findings and ours suggest another form of cognitive simplification has been brought into play, this one related to the bandwagon effect, in which people simply ‘go along’ with majority positions” (291).D’Alessio’s study also showed that those claiming there was bias in a news stor y were likely to point to quotes that fall outside their latitude of acceptance as making a story biased. This puts journalists in a tough position, he said, because this perception of bias results from the person who is quoted, not the journalist. It shows that simply by offering supporting quotes from each side, a journalist is opening up him or herself to accusations of bias.

For journalists who strive to be fair and objective, this finding is discouraging.Another cause of the perception of media bias to undergo examination has been the similarity of those whom partisan people tend to talk to. Eveland and Shah carried out a study predicting that partisans who undertook discussions with other partisans would perceive a greater degree of press bias in the media. They found that Republican Party identification, strong partisanship, and political involvement were positively associated with perceptions of news bias. The extent to which these groups have political conversations with like-minded people significantly increases the perception that there is widespread bias. They write, “People who frequently discuss politics with others who share their views likely have distorted standards of what constitutes unbiased media content” (113).

These findings support those of Gunther and Klapper, who cited the role groups play in reinforcing ideas and sparking skepticism about the sources of media that challenge group ideas and norms.Questions of audience perceptionIn his book Tilted: The Search for Media Bias, David Niven acknowledges the literature that says claims of media bias are a matter of audience perception, not of the actual content of news. But he raises questions about audience perception being the sole cause of media claims. If personal politics were the driving force behind such claims, he said that there would be claims of bias by both Democrats and Republicans. Niven states: “Both Democrats and Republicans should see massive bias in the news because of the steady stream of two-sided information in the media, half of which is sure to offend them,” (Niven 45) He does not substantiate with research his claim that information in the media is two-sided.Karlberg and Hackett also challenge the contention that the hostile media phenomenon is in large part to blame for partisan assertions that the news is biased and that journalists will insulate themselves from allegations of bias by “playing it down the middle” and covering both sides.

The two undertook a survey in Canada between respondents on opposite ends of the political spectrum  (conservative/establishment and progressive/advocacy groups) asking them to identify weaknesses in media coverage. They sought to find out whether criticisms from the two groups would be mutually contradictory, which they said would be evidence of the hostile media phenomenon. The researchers found that criticisms of the two groups were not contradictory. “Both groups were critical of the media for insufficiently covering positive stores and the social implications of economic policies (Karlberg & Hackettp; Discussion section 5). They went on to say, “The key point here is the intergroup similarity and the indication that dissatisfaction with media performance cannot be reduced to perceptions of hostile ‘bias’” (Karlberg & Hackett Discussion section 5). This is one of the few studies undertaken to challenge the hostile media effect, but the study’s lack of focus on a specific issue may have failed to generate the passion and feelings necessary among specific groups of partisans as previous studies have.

Niven summarized the challenges media outlets face in today’s landscape. Whether perceptions of media bias are a result of audience perceptions or true bias in the news, the media still must respond or face a dearth of readers and viewers. He said this pressure has forced media organizations back in time.

The partisan press died years ago because the demand for neutral, balanced coverage outweighed the demand for news catering to specific groups holding specific beliefs. America gave bir h to a press steeped in partisanship. Writing about the press in the late 1700s and early 1800s, Sloan and Startt state: “Clearly, editors believed the overriding purpose of the press was to serve a partisan cause” (73).

They say the distinctive characteristic of the press from 1783 to 1833 was political partisanship, and they point out that newspapers played an important role during a critical stage in American politics.During this time, as the Constitution was being ratified and America’s democracy was being shaped, readers were “annoyed” when a newspaper would not take a partisan stand and had little respect for an impartial editor. This continued throughout the 1800s and early 1900s, when circulation of large dailies was tied to political parties. But in 1920, Walter Lippmann, editor of the New York World, called for the professional training of reporters in techniques related to objectivity: attributing information to official sources, balancing coverage by telling both sides of an issue, and offering context to news events instead of presenting facts in isolation (Sloan & Startt).

Objectivity has been the gold standard in journalism since then, even though public officials throughout modern history have challenged the press’s objectivity.But today, technology is giving viewers and readers more choices. Along with the growing number of cable channels, people can find their own niche of likeminded folk and news and information catered to their interest on the Internet. Niven predicted that the popularity of conservative talk radio is the beginning of Republicans fleeing the mainstream media. He stated: “Ironically, the logical extension of the flight of conservatives from mainstream media is the rebirth of the partisan press” (Niven 49-50). This observation points to the growing potential for audiences to separate into niches based on their own preferences, and in this case, based on their political views.

Webster summarized the social implications of audience fragmentation that could be sparked by partisans’ fleeing mainstream news media, saying a “worrisome prospect is that technology and advertiser-driven programming will reconfigure the mass audience into many small, relative exclusive communities of interest that never encounter dissident voices or different points of view” (366).HypothesesThis study seeks to expand on previous studies done on the hostile media effect by examining whether preconceived notions about a media source make a difference in perceptions of media bias and whether they play into the hostile media phenomenon. To explore this question, an experiment was undertaken. To test for the hostile media effect, a newspaper story on a development related to the war in Iraq was presented to research subjects. The same story was made to appear in three different made-up newspapers: The Conservative Times-Herald, The Liberal Times Media Herald and The Times-Herald. Research subjects received one of the three versions.Based on the literature, the following hypotheses have been formed.

Hypothesis 1: Partisans on both sides of the issue will rate the story that appears in the three sources as biased against their point of view based on their overall assessment of bias and how they feel each side is portrayed in the story.Hypothesis 2: Overall, partisans on both sides of the issue will rate satisfaction with the story as low and rate themselves as less likely to turn to the source in the future to get information.Hypothesis 3: The level of perceived bias within each group of partisans will correlate negatively with their level of satisfaction with the story and the likelihood they will return to that source for information on the issue.Hypothesis 4: Partisans on both sides of the issue are likely to go to media they deem friendly toward their views to get more information on the war in Iraq. MethodsStimuli and research sampleThese hypotheses will be tested through an experimental design in which participants randomly receive a news story related to the issue of the war in Iraq in one of the three stimuli mentioned above. The news story was about Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a fallen soldier who made headlines carrying out war protests at President Bush’s ranch in Crawford, Texas, and at the White House in 2005. The story is made up with quotes and information from articles that appeared in The Los Angeles Times, The San Francisco Chronicle, The Washington Post, and on the Associated Press wire the day after she was arrested for protesting in front of the White House."
,,,,,media,,,,,,,,,"The stories were found by carrying out a keyword search on “Cindy Sheehan” in Lexis Nexis. The composite story is made to be as fair and balanced as possible by including information about Sheehan and anti-war protests as well as information about rallies staged in support of the administration that same weekend.The articles are formatted to appear as if they were printed out from the newspapers’ Web sites. The names of the three stimuli are selected to answer the question: Does media source play a role in the perception of media bias? Will partisans (conservatives and liberals) deem a story biased simply based on the names of the newspapers? Made-up newspapers are chosen over existing publications because research subjects may not be familiar with the leanings the editorial pages some nationally circulated news publications are said to have.Included in subjects’ packet will be a pre-test seeking standard demographic information as well as questions asking about party affiliation, religiosity, and how much time they spend with media each day.

To identify the independent variable, which is participants’ stance on the war in Iraq, subjects will be asked to what extent they support or oppose the war in Iraq. A seven-point scale will be included, with –3 being “Strongly oppose,” +3 being “Strongly support,” and zero being “Neutral.” The scale is adapted from a similar 11-point scale that Schmitt and colleagues used in a study testing for the hostile media effect when it came to information on the issue of the development of genetically modified foods. Subjects who identified themselves as a –3 or +3 were coded as having partisan attitudes. Those who identified themselves on the scale as –2, –1, zero, –1, +1, or +2 were coded as having neutral attitudes.

Participants will be asked to read the news story in their packet and proceed to the post-test, adapted from the questionnaire Schmitt and colleagues used in their study. To measure the dependent variable, which was perceived bias, subjects will be asked to rate different aspects of the story on the same seven-point scale used above.Questions included, “Would you say that the portrayal of the war in Iraq in this article was strictly neutral, or was it biased in favor of one side or the other?” “Would you say the portrayal of the opponents of the war in Iraq in this article was strictly neutral, or was it biased for or against them?” and “Would you say the portrayal of supporters of the war in Iraq in this article was simply neutral, or was it biased for or against them?” Two items will be included asking what percentage of the story is favorable to the issue of the war and what percentage is unfavorable. Questions will be also asked about the source the story appeared in. Subjects will be asked to rank on the seven-point scale how they felt future stories on the issue would be covered in the source they read, whether it would the The Conservative Times-Herald, The Liberal Times-Herald, or The Times-Herald.Another section of questions was included to understand whether partisans seek out media they see as friendly toward their views in reaction to an article they perceive as biased.

Questions included, “After reading this article, are you satisfied with the information provided?” and “In the future, if you wanted find out more about the war in Iraq, would you be likely to turn to this source?” The final question asked the following: “Where would you go to get the most reliable information on the latest developments in the war in Iraq? Please rank the following choices.” Sources included cable networks such as Fox News and CNN; non-mainstream news sources such as “The Daily Show,” Rush Limbaugh’s radio show, Al Franken’s radio show, the Drudge Report and the Daily Kos blog; news magazines such as The Weekly Standard and The Nation; and mainstream newspapers such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.Conducting the testThe researcher will undertake the experiment with a convenience sample: undergraduate students. A total of 30 students will be in attendance on the day the study will be administered in early January 2007. The researcher will offer no incentive to complete the survey other than to explain that students’ participation would help to better understand attitudes about news coverage of the war in Iraq. The questionnaires will be distributed randomly by teaching assistants blind to the hypotheses in class. Subjects will be given roughly 25 minutes to take complete the questionnaire.

Standard debriefing procedures will be undertaken after the questionnaires will be handed in to let subjects know that they will be deceived and that none of the news sources contained in their packets exist in real life. Expectations and ConclusionsEvidence of the hostile media effectBoth strong opponents and strong supporters would demonstrate evidence of the hostile media effect. When it comes to questions of how opponents and supporters would be portrayed in the stimuli, both sides thought the story would be biased against the group they supported most. For example, strong supporters of the war would show a much stronger perception of bias than strong opponents of the war.  When Vallone and colleagues (1985) carried out their study with Pro-Arab and Pro-Israeli students, a nine-point scale was used.

Partisans were clustered more toward the extreme ends of the scale than in the present study, in which partisans would be remained more likely in the center. Such results are expected in this study.Previous studies on the hostile media effect have used partisan subjects from groups in which formal membership is required. In the Vallone study, researchers recruited members of pro-Arab and pro- Israeli student associations. Schmitt and colleagues selected partisans on the issue of development of genetically modified foods by going to annual meetings of groups with strong positions on the issue. Those who have done studies on the hostile media effect have recruited highly involved participants because the literature states that group membership is a high predictor of the hostile media effect.

Christen and colleagues argue that, “While attitude extremity may be necessary, membership in a formal group (with its attendant effects on self-identity and depth of commitment) appears to be a sufficient condition for the hostile media perception” (433). As a result, they say, partisans in more general audiences would not show as strong of evidence of the hostile media effect. While targeting highly partisan groups in this way helps researcher understand more about the hostile media effect and how it plays out, the results can’t necessarily be generalized to the rest of the population.ConclusionThe results of this study and other studies on the hostile media effect should give journalists some hope. While a small and vocal group are making claims of media bias, the majority of the public who take in news and information sources seem to sense that media outlets are fairly neutral when presenting the news. It is unlikely that any publisher fears losing a substantial number of readers or viewers because of claims of bias — the level of discourse on the media today indicates that people are paying attention. The rise of news and information sources, while fragmenting audiences, has the potential to draw more people into the national conversation than ever before. This expansion is the upside of segmentation — more diversity in voices.

Such diversity has the potential to lead to a better democracy. But there are dangers with audience segmentation as well. A study by Mendelsohn and Nadeau found that exposing audiences to the same group of national opinion leaders and media messages led those who initially took varying stances on issues of national importance to become less varied in their opinions. The arrival of narrowcast media, they predict, will raise number of voices, which could be a good thing, but also enhance polarization and cleavages in public opinion, which could be a bad thing. Such cleavages could result in an increase in class politics, religious divisions, and party identification.Thus, it is important to be aware of the consequences of the hostile media effect as it relates to media choice and audience fragmentation.

Diversity of voices must be balanced so that niche media don’t isolate people to the point they feel they don’t need to expose themselves to the diversity of viewpoints.

news, lifestyles and current affairs",,,,,,,,,"Everywhere, every day, exciting things are happening. Each day is filled with news. People learn news and views during reading newspapers and magazines, talking over the telephone or they are kept informed by watching TV or listening to the radio. The press, the radio and television play a big role in the life of the society. They inform, educate and entertain people. They also influence the way people look at the world and make them change their views.

Mass media plays a very important role in organizing public opinion. Millions of people watch TV and read newspapers in their free time. Most of people can't do without a newspaper in the underground or during the lunch break. TV also dominates the life of the family most of the time. It is also a habit which impossible to resist. The radio is turned on most of the time, creating a permanent background noise. So Mass Media become a very important part of our life. Mass media denotes a section of the media specifically designed to reach a large audience. The term was coined in the 1920s with the advent of nationwide radio networks, mass-circulation newspapers and magazines. However, some forms of mass media such as books and manuscripts had already been in use for centuries.

Mass media can be used for various purposes: advocacy, both for business and social concerns. This can include advertising, marketing, propaganda, public relations, and political communication. Entertainment, traditionally through performances of acting, music, and sports, along with light reading. Since the late 20th century also through video and computer games. Journalism is the discipline of collecting, analyzing, verifying and presenting information regarding current events, trends, issues and people. Those who practice journalism are known as journalists. Electronic media and print media include: Broadcasting, in the narrow sense, for radio and television. Many instances of various types of recorded discs or tapes. In the 20th century, these were mainly used for music. Video and computer uses followed. Film, most often used for entertainment, but also for documentaries.

The Internet, which has many uses and presents both opportunities and challenges. Examples can include Blogs and podcasts (such as news, music, pre-recorded speech, and video) Mobile phones, which can be used for rapid breaking news and short clips of entertainment like jokes, horoscopes, alerts, games, music, and advertising. Publishing, including electronic publishing Video games, which have developed into a mass form of media since cutting-edge devices such as the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii broadened their use. Millions of copies of newspapers appear every day. Many people subscribe to two or more newspapers; others buy newspapers at the newsstands. Most newspapers contain news, detailed articles on home and international affairs, reviews of books, art and TV shows. Many of them also cover sports events. In the USA daily newspapers are published in 34 different languages. The Internet has recently become another important source of information. Its main advantage is that news appears on the screen as soon as things happen in real life and you don't have to wait for news time on TV.

TV is one of the best inventions the man ever made. We are really beginning to forget what the world was without TV. Everybody knows what a great force is TV in the world today. We become better informed by watching documentaries, science programs, discussions and political issues of the day. TV gives us opportunities to see the best actors, sport matches, to meet famous people. TV brings the world to our room. TV helps us to relax after a hard days work. Besides there is a considerable amount of TV programs (News, current affairs viewpoint. Musical Reviews, Sports Review, Travelers Clubs, Good Night Kids. etc) and they gather big audience. They provide useful topics for conversation, wise heated discussions. Current Affairs (Viewpoint, News) These programs deal with political and social problems of modern society. Their aim is to give an analyze of the problems and to show different viewpoints. They are concerned with the counties national events. They show meetings with famous political analysts, discussing the most topical political problems of today. To my mind we can't imagine our lives without mass media. It is silly to avoid it as we can use its advantages.Though we should be careful and filter all information we get."

             Most of us think in terms of illness, and assume that wellness indicates the absence of illness. To me wellness involves giving good care to your physical self, using your mind constructively, expressing your emotions effectively, being creatively involved with those around you, and being concerned about your physical, psychological and spiritual environment. Wellness means more than not being sick; it means taking steps to prevent illness and to lead a richer, more balanced, and more satisfying life. 
             The physical dimension of wellness deals with the functional operation of the body and involves health related components of physical fitness. Some days this semester I have not been able to make it to the gym to do my routine workout, but on the days that I can not make it I have found other ways to incorporate physical activity into my daily schedule. I have increased the intensity levels in my housework; I have spent at least 30 minutes every day doing strenuous yard work, and walking or jogging with my puppy everyday also keeps me physically active. The only change in my diet since the beginning of the semester was an increase in fiber in my diet. I am still maintaining my weight, however from my body fat analysis I am at the normal BMI for women my age but I still have a plan of attack to decrease even more body fat. After my results from the flexibility test, I have religiously incorporated even more stretching into my daily routine. 
             The intellectual dimension of wellness involves the use of your mind. Well I have no problems in that area, being that I have to study everyday since I am in college. Since I have a craving for information, my mind is always reading books, exploring the internet for information, or just gaining valuable information from those around me.

It would be best if you were taking the right amount of proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and fats to help you have a proper diet.

However, we must remember that a healthy lifestyle not only refers to our physical and mental health. Maintaining a balanced diet, exercising daily, and sleeping well are essential parts of a healthy lifestyle. But feeling happy is also a big part of a healthy lifestyle. To enable happiness, thinking positively is a must. When a person does not feel happy or good about themselves, they are not entirely healthy. Thus we must do our best to think positively so that we can feel happy rather than sad.
We have talked about what all entails a healthy life, so now we must speak of what all does not. There are several things that one must avoid in order to live a healthy lifestyle. These include the kind of practices and habits that are harmful to us and also to the people around us, i.e., society. Such practices and habits include gambling, smoking, drinking, illegal drugs, or any other things that can turn into an addiction.

However this definition does not pertain much to marketing, or consumer purchasing habits. Another definition that would be of more relevance and importance to marketers is  “Lifestyle refers to a pattern of consumption, of how he or she spends their time and money”.
A lifestyle marketing perspective shows how people sort themselves into groups on the basis of activities they enjoy, how they spend their free time, and how they spend their disposable income. This gives marketers a chance for market segmentation strategies. Market…show more content…
Psychographics is basically the separation of customers into categories depending on different choices in consumption activities, and product usage. 
Marketers were always fascinated by the intangibles of consumer demand but it wasn’t until the 1960s when social upheaval splintered the mass market beyond anything recognizable that marketers invented a way to measure those intangibles. However despite being around for over 30 years or so Psychographics is still one of the least understood concepts in marketing research.
Many marketers consider demographics and psychographics as two separate things when in actuality psychographics was developed to compliment demographics. The term first appeared in Grey Advertising’s publication “Grey Matter” in 1965. It was hailed as a way for researchers to quantify the slippery field of consumer psychology. 
A psycho graphic study combines consumers’ measurable demographic characteristics with the more abstract aspects of attitudes, opinions, and interests. Demographic, purchasing media, and psycho graphic information is coded from surveys, thrown together and analyzed until some groups with shared characteristics are can be distinguished from all other groups.

,,,,,"news, lifestyles and current affairs",,,,,,,,,"“Life style” is a term which we generally use to mean the way people live reflecting the entire range of social values, attitudes and activities.

It includes lifelong personal habits and also cultural and behavioral patterns. It is through the social interaction with parents, groups, and friends and through school and mass media we get to our lifestyle.

Today our health, fitness and illness are greatly influenced by our lifestyle which covers many aspects of human behaviors like patterns of eating, drinking (alcohol), smoking, exercises, drug dependence, human reproduction, sexual behaviors etc. Promotion of health requires a healthy lifestyle.
In the developed countries nowadays many major health problems e.g. coronary heart diseases, obesity, lung cancer, drug addiction, alcohol abuse, automobile accidents, suicides, and homicides etc. are linked with lifestyle changes.

In developing countries like ours, risks of illness and death still have a connection with the traditional lifestyles characterized by poor sanitation condition, poor nutrition, personal hygiene, elementary human habits, customs and cultural patterns etc.

Factors like adequate nutrition, enough sleep, sufficient physical activity, personal hygiene, habits and behavior contribute to promote optimum health and all these are deeply related to individual lifestyles.

Lifestyle change more than any other factor is considered to be the best way of preventing illness and early death in our society. It is clear from a recent report published by Public Health Service in United States that the percentage contribution of four sources to early death reveals that Life care system accounts for 9.8%, Human biology for 16.4%, Environment for 21.8% while Lifestyle alone contribute 83.5%."
,,,,,"news, lifestyles and current affairs",,,,,,,,,"The implication is that active living contributes significantly to good health and wellbeing, can enhance health and quality of life. And all of us should learn to alter our lifestyles to foster lifetime fitness and wellness.

Two concepts “Health” and “Wellness” should be clearly understood in order to understand their relation to lifestyle.

“Health” is optimal wellbeing that contributes to quality of life. It is more than freedom from disease and illness which are associated with circumstances that upset homeostasis, although freedom from disease is important to good health. Optimum health includes high level mental, social, emotional, spiritual, and physical fitness within limits of one’s heredity and personal disabilities.

“Wellness” is the integration of all parts of health and fitness (mental, emotional, spiritual and physical) that expands one’s potential to live and work effectively and to make a significant contribution to society.
Wellness reflects how one feels (a sense of wellbeing) about life as well as one’s ability to function effectively. Wellness is opposed to illness, is sometimes described as the positive components of good health. Healthy lifestyle is critical to wellness.

Just as modern-day illness like heart disease, cancer and diabetes, high blood sugar and blood pressure problems are caused mostly by unhealthy lifestyle; healthy lifestyle can ensure an improved feeling of wellness. Regular physical activity leads to healthy lifestyle to prevent hypo kinetic diseases and conditions.

A positive total outlook on life is essential to wellness. A person with wellness is one who finds satisfaction in work, is spiritually fulfilled, enjoys leisure time, is physically fit, socially involved and has a positive emotional-mental outlook. This can be put in the following tabular form:

Three strategies can be applied to achieve optimal health for all people. They are:

i) Disease and illness treatment

ii) Disease and illness prevention

iii) Health and wellness promotion

The first strategy includes such efforts as to treat and cure common diseases and illness. In this strategy maximum responsibility rests on the medical and health professionals.The second strategy includes measures that will help prevent disease and illness and here much of the burden lies with the communities and individuals within these communities although the fact remains that the medical and public health agencies have a great role to play in implementing this strategy.

The third strategy i.e. Health and Wellness promotion includes efforts to bring changes in lifestyles to enhance the quality of life that helps people to achieve their potential to live full active lives. Whereas the treatment and prevention strategies focus on illness, disease and eventually at Death’s door; promotion strategies focus on wellness."
,,,,,"news, lifestyles and current affairs",,,,,,,,,"Today, a lot of people sit throughout whole days in offices in front of their PCs and forget how important it is to do regular physical exercises. In fact, they have to be involved in everyone’s daily routine. Apart from doing exercises, it is important to mind what you eat during your day. The modern lifestyle of coach potatoes or fanatic office workers, which many people choose, will certainly bring about a lot of negative results. Despite the fact that everyone is aware of the bad consequences their lifestyle can bring, they do not stop leading them and eating junk food.

People in favor of active lifestyle know that healthy food can be really tasty. In fact, the taste of junk food seems terrible to them. That is the right life position, to which all the people have to strive. In addition, junk food can cause a lot of diseases. The high fat content in these food items can result in obesity and will definitely shorten your life.

If you want to live longer, the first thing that you have to do is to get accustomed to healthy food and forget all the addresses of fast food restaurants. The other one is to stop making up excuses for not doing physical exercises. It doesn’t mean that you have to have long daily work-outs. All you have to do is allocate 20 to 30 minutes a day for some simple, but extremely useful moves of your body.

Thus, all you have to do is make a decision whether to live your life full of diseases and boring daily activities, or to take a position of active person, involved in many different events without the constant need to go to the hospital."
,,,,,"news, lifestyles and current affairs",,,,,,,,,"There is no escape. It encompasses every factor of the modern  American lifestyle. It all begins with ""The American Dream,"" in which everyone  strives to become part of the ideal, the obsession, that supposedly defines how  happiness can be obtained. But happiness is not, contrary to the beliefs of the  American Dreamers, measured on a checklist including 2.5 kids, 1 dog, 1 cat,  quaint house in suburbs, white picket fence, 2 car garage, freshly mowed lawn,  etc. That image is a facade over the ever-crumbling ashheaps of our world. It is  impossible to measure one's life or happiness on a scale of coffee spoons, cars,  or annual income, but people continue to plug away like machines for no other  reason than to make the money that they honestly believe will bring them true  happiness. This idea is everywhere, leaving much of America longing for a life  that does not exist and working toward a goal that will never be reached.
It is not difficult to fall into the trap of the American ideal because we  are already accustomed to absorbing, using, eating, believing every other  man-made product, and the ideal is, in fact, just another fabrication of the  society. Man is ungrateful, casting aside all that he has not manufactured or  processed, abandoning the natural world from which he has emerged. America has  been turned into ""an immense country filled with decent houses, good roads,  orchards, meadows, and bridges, where a hundred years ago all was wild, woody,  and uncultivated"" (St. Jean de Crevecoeur 440). Henderson searches for himself  away from all that man has made, becoming dismayed to find that others have been  to what he considers the beginning of the earth; even there the effect of  society has seeped into life, takinlack of motivation. It is easy to fall  victim to a lack of motivation upon seeing the collapse of the dream that was  once the main driving force for people to work at all. The most powerful example  of an ingredient missing in the wasteland is love. Love is the ultimate truth  and the ultimate motivation, so when Frome has no love at all in his life and is  left without any escape from his moral isolation, the wasteland cannot be  denied. Likewise, when there is no love for what someone does and he only does  it for the sake of living up to the ideal, such as the Lomans', the demise of  the fantastic facade, and thus the onset of the wasteland, cannot be stopped.  The wasteland inhabits all aspects of society today. It is a dark, gloomy cloud  that hovers over the earth, blocking all hope-all life-from making its way into  the reality of the world in which we live.

,,,,,"news, lifestyles and current affairs",,,,,,,,,"Homosexuality is becoming more and more accepted and integrated into today’s society, however, when it comes to homosexuals establishing families, a problem is posed.  In most states, homosexuals can adopt children like any other married or single adult.  There are many arguments to this controversial topic; some people believe that it should be legal nationally, while others would prefer that is was banned everywhere, or at least in their individual states.  There are logical reasons to allow gays to adopt children, but for some, these reasons are not enough.  The main issue really is, what is in the best interest of the child?  This type of problem isn’t really one with causes, effects, and solutions, but one with pros and cons.  Like any other adoption situation, a parent prove themselves to be responsible and capable enough to raise a child on their own, or with a spouse.



This problem or issue is one that is proving to be a bigger one than many people most likely expected.  In Today’s more liberal society, homosexuality seeing more acceptance than ever before.  Homosexuals and heterosexuals alike have parental instincts and are as interested in beginning families and raising children.  A family should be based on love and trust, if these two elements are present in a relationship, homosexual or heterosexual, there would be no reason that the environment the couple creates for a child would be bad.  Some say the homosexual lifestyle revolves only around sex, which of course is the most inappropriate subject for a child. (White)  For the most part, parents and adults keep what happens behind closed doors, private, therefore, there would be no reason for a homosexual person to flaunt their sex life, especially in front of a child.



Pros of Adoption by Gay Parents



Adoption is a very important part of the American lifestyle.  The welfare of children needs to be put in front of homophobia.  There are an estimated 500,000 children in foster care nation wide, and 100,000 of these children are awaiting adoption.  In 2013, only one child of every six available for adoption was actually adopted. (Sanchez, 13)  Statistics like these show the true importance of adoption.  People seem to prefer to have their own children biologically, but adoption should be taken into consideration, even if natural conception is possible."
,,,,,"news, lifestyles and current affairs",,,,,,,,,"The Impact of the American Lifestyle on the Planet



Haven’t you heard this BIG news? Maybe you haven’t, perhaps distracted by recent headlines surrounding the war or Santa Claus. Well, only last week more definitive evidence came forth which demonstrates that bigfoot does exist. It is we. Yes, those of us in the United States, on average, have the biggest feet on the planet. Surprised? I am not writing here about shoe size—the literal interpretation—but rather the individual impact that our lifestyles have on the planet. This metaphorical footprint has been shown to be a very useful way to evaluate the impact each one of us is having.



You see, several researchers have recently determined to what extent the way in which we live has a quantifiable impact on our planet. Our footprint actually has been calculated and it has the units of acres. In other words, your day-to-day activities have an impact on the quality of air, water, and land that we breathe, drink, or stand on, and these can be collectively combined and represented by a particular land area.



But what is the connection between a land area and your annual production of carbon dioxide (via driving) or your yearly dietary needs? Well it is pretty simple, according to Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees, authors of the must-read entitled, Our Ecological Footprint. All humans require land area for two fundamental purposes. First, land (or ocean) provides the materials that people need to live, such as food, wood, aluminum, etc. Second, land (or ocean) must also absorb and recycle the waste that our species produces. Since human life necessitates the use of resources as well as the production of waste, each one of us requires a certain acreage for our survival. But to overuse and misuse of resources on a massive scale. Yet, as dismal as our current position, we also have the capacity to change. Our institutions and industries have the potential to promote the most humane virtues of equality, fairness, camaraderie, wisdom and ingenuity all within the guidelines prescribed by our planet. It is incumbent upon us to provide the will and the resolve to see that they do so. History has shown that it won’t happen without our persistence and dedication. Perhaps next year, our footprints will be the major topic of discussion in our media. There is my wish for the New Year."

""We are not doing the same kind of things with obesity that we have done with smoking and alcohol as far as the government isconcerned. It's got to be like smoking, a constant drumbeat."" That's former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, appearing on CNN, January 11, 2000, calling for the nation's lifestyle Nazis to attack fat people as they attacked smokers.
Lifestyle Nazis aren't settling on just obesity, they're targeting meat consumption. Dr. Neal Barnard, president of Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine says, ""It's time we looked at holding the meat producers and fast-food outlets legally responsible. Meat consumption is just as dangerous to public health as tobacco use."" Doing their part to ban meat consumption, professors at law schools such as Harvard, Rutgersand Georgetown are teaching ""animal law"" courses. Animals are seen as plaintiffs. Law professors are gearing up by studying old slavery statutes that authorized legal nonpersons to bring lawsuits. Possibly, before long, we might see chickens, cows, pigs and other critters appearing as plaintiffs in court suing for crimes against animals.
Morgan Leyh, a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) says, ""Eating meat is a rich versus poor issue. The rich get fat on meat, while the poor are starving because all the grain is fed to cattle. It's selfish to eat meat - there is no excuse for eating meat."" So far as America's poor, that claim reflects unadulterated stupidity. American obesity is mostly a health problem of poor people. But stupidity and callousness is par for the course for PETA. It was PETA president, Ingrid Newkirk, who said slaughter of millions of chickens is a greater tragedy than the Nazi holocaust. She also said that a boy is no more valuable than a clam.
PETA has fellow travelers. Guest Choice (www.guestchoice.com) cites fellow traveler, Paul Shapiro, a member of Compassion Over Killing, as saying, ""Animals are the most oppressed group on the face of the planet. Eating meat is unethical - it is not your right to say an animal's life is worth a pleasant taste sensation in your mouth.""
Suppose we didn't slaughter cows for their meat but, instead, just drank their milk? We wouldn't be off the hook; there are anti-milk Nazis. Robert Cohen, a.k.a. ""Notmilk Man"", director of the Anti-Dairy Coalition, says that there is ""no nutritional value to drinking milk.

The government has to do a lot of lying and exaggerating to keep the American standard of living attainable. People do not realize that a lot of their material items (i.e. oil) come from overseas. The way American officials choose to obtain this oil is through military force and strong attempts to control the world. When citizens see the country this way they get upset; no one likes the idea of murdering innocent people just to drive to work in the morning. Instead, the administration creates a long string of lies to keep people oblivious and happy. They use events such as 9/11 and Pearl Harbor to explain warfare. In Bacevich’s essay, “The Real World War IV,” he shows how these wars begin far before the citizens are aware. Gilbert, in “Immune to Reality,” demonstrates that an explanation for a war puts the mind at ease, “but the cost is that it makes us strangers to ourselves” (Gilbert 216). Controlling the people is the only way for the government to continue its way of life. They claim to be fighting for America’s protection, but it seems to be more for superiority amongst other nations. Susan Faludi describes a similar hierarchy administration in “The Naked Citadel.” She studied the young men attending school at The Citadel in hopes to find out why men have so much anger towards women. The Citadel has been an all boy school since 1882, and none of the administrators want to let their tradition go.

Vanishing acts are common in the ransomware world, where gangs tend to disappear and rebrand when they begin attracting too much heat.

Both the group’s payment portal and its blog, which named and shamed their victims who refused to pay, were unreachable on Tuesday.

REvil – a Russia-linked cybercrime ring, which in recent weeks claimed responsibility for a sprawling ransomware outbreak that affected an estimated 800 to 1,500 businesses worldwide – was already drawing top-level US government attention.

President Joe Biden hinted on Friday the United States could take more aggressive action soon where ransomware was concerned.

Asked by a Reuters correspondent whether it would make sense to attack the Russian servers used in such intrusions, Biden paused, smiled and said: “Yes.”"
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"A meadow froghopper urinates so much that it could drown itself. Luckily, the insect Philaenus spumarius, which is approximately the size of a Tic Tac, has a butt catapult that regularly flicks its globules of liquid waste into the air and safely away from its body.

Sign up for Science Times  Get stories that capture the wonders of nature, the cosmos and the human body. Sign up.
“At this tiny, tiny scale, ballistics become really complicated,” said Philip G. D. Matthews, an associate professor of comparative physiology in the zoology department at the University of British Columbia. “But they can flick it away pretty far,” he said, clarifying that “pretty far” here means two to four inches.

Among entomologists, the froghoppers’ urinary powers are well understood. But the insects’ suction abilities, which long confounded scientists, have turned out to be much more impressive, according to a paper on the meadow froghoppers’ feeding mechanisms published on Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Froghoppers are common in Europe and North America and are known to spread certain bacterial diseases among plants. They urinate almost constantly because the insects feed on pure xylem sap, a liquid that is so bereft of nutrients one must sip and sip and sip, sometimes up to 24 hours straight.

Most sap-drinking insects drink phloem, a sugary liquid in plant vessels that is easy to get because it is driven by positive pressure, meaning it gushes forth from a plant stem once pierced by mouthparts. In contrast, xylem is driven by negative pressure — its vessels actually pull inward — which makes the watery liquid excruciatingly difficult to suck out. Such negative pressures exist inside the unbroken columns of xylem vessels where water is pulled up from the roots into the leaves to evaporate into the atmosphere, Dr. Matthews said.

To show the power of the froghoppers’ suction, Dr. Matthews, Elisabeth Bergman, a master’s student he advised, and Emma Green, an undergraduate volunteer, examined the insects’ morphology and tested their metabolic abilities in 2019. Their test subjects hailed from the weeds near their lab.

The researchers took Micro-CT scans of the heads of adult froghoppers and analyzed the morphology of their cibarial pump, a structure in their head that allows them to pull the xylem sap into their face. Like a plunger inside a syringe, a diaphragm is pulled by muscles to increase the volume of the chamber and draw in xylem sap. As froghoppers must rhythmically pull on this diaphragm to suck, the nose-like structure between their eyes, called a post-clypeus, is terrifically strong to accommodate all of that muscle.

“It’s like a huge bicep on their head,” Dr. Matthews said.

Using the dimensions of the froghoppers’ cibarial pumps, the researchers calculated how much negative pressure the insects might be able to generate inside their head. Their calculations suggested froghoppers might be able to generate up to 1.6 megapascals, a pressure greater than the tension inside many xylem vessels.

This showed the froghoppers were capable of sucking much more than anyone previously believed. If the insects “were on the top of the Statue of Liberty’s torch, they could have a straw going all the way down to the ground going into a glass of water, and they could be quite happily sucking it up,” Dr. Matthews said, adding that the froghoppers would still be fine even yards above the torch.

After calculating the insects’ powerful suction, the researchers wanted to confirm the action didn’t use more energy than it gained. To test this, they placed froghoppers and a length of pea plant in airtight acrylic chambers to measure how much carbon dioxide the insect produced after 30 minutes of slurping sap.

Although the insects appeared still to the human eye, magnified videos of the froghoppers’ faces revealed just how much their face muscles move during feeding.

“All of a sudden, a bug sitting there doing nothing looks like its nose is jiggling around like crazy,” Dr. Matthews said, referring to the froghopper’s post-clypeus.

The pea plant was grown hydroponically, bare roots dangling into a solution of nutrients. This made it easy to swap out the solution for polyethylene glycol, a fluid with even stronger negative pressure than the nutrient solution. Dr. Matthews compared drinking the polyethylene glycol to a cyclist biking up a hill instead of on flat ground. The researchers reasoned the froghoppers would slow down when faced with the even more resistant fluid. But the froghoppers managed to keep up their same sucking velocity, albeit with a rocketing metabolic rate.

Alberto Fereres, an entomologist in Madrid, said the study helped to explain how P. spumarius could feed on plants with “very negative tensions,” such as rain-fed olives and grapevines

The metabolic measurements demonstrated the insects could gain more energy than they expended even while sucking xylem sap at full throttle. “That’s their existence,” Dr. Matthews said. “Drinking and filtering and peeing and pumping.”

Though this process is extreme on the side of a froghopper, a single sucking bug would most likely be imperceptible to any plant. Unless, of course, there is an infestation, in which case its copious gobs of butt-flung liquid waste can even resemble rain."
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"In 2017, a rosy wolf snail crawled along a sunlit trail in Tahiti with an unexpected passenger: a bespoke computer the size of an aphid, screwed delicately on its shell like a top hat.

Sign up for Science Times  Get stories that capture the wonders of nature, the cosmos and the human body. Sign up.
This particular species of snail is implicated in the extinctions of as many as 134 snail species worldwide. People introduced the carnivorous rosy wolf snail to Tahiti decades ago, and the predatory species left few survivors.

But one Tahitian species managed to survive in dozens of valleys on the island: the tiny yogurt-colored snail Partula hyalina. “There must be something special about them,” said Cindy Bick, a researcher at the University of Michigan.

Now, with solar data collected from some of the world’s tiniest computers attached to the shell of the rosy wolf and the leafy habitat of P. hyalina, Dr. Bick and her colleagues have illuminated how P. hyalina’s pale shell enabled the species to skirt extinction. Their results were published in June in Communications Biology.
In 2012, when Dr. Bick was still a graduate student, she began investigating the mystery of P. hyalina’s survival along with Diarmaid Ó Foighil, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and curator at the university’s Museum of Zoology. Together, they published a 2014 paper suggesting the species’ more bountiful clutch of offspring helped it survive better than other species. But even this was not enough to explain P. hyalina’s rare success. “It’s doing more than surviving,” Dr. Ó Foighil said.

Most land snails prefer the shade. The dark-shelled rosy wolf snail, like many species, would dry out like jerky if left in the sun. But Dr. Bick read while doing research in the field journals of an early 20th-century malacologist that P. hyalina were often found on forest edges, where trees thin out in sunlight.

Dr. Bick and Dr. Ó Foighil started thinking: If P. hyalina’s milky shell can reflect back and tolerate more sunlight, sunny forest fringes might offer a safe haven free from the rosy wolf. They just needed a way to measure how much sunlight each species received each day.

As the two zoologists were pondering snails, across campus, David Blaauw’s engineering lab had created the world’s smallest computer that has a battery: a 2-by-5-by-2 millimeter sensor slightly bigger than an aphid. The sensors receive data with visible light and transmit it through a radio.

Several years later, Dr. Blaauw’s team received a request that stood out: to attach the tiny computers to carnivorous snails in Tahiti. Dr. Bick’s proposal seemed perfect — a chance to test the sensors in the real world with collaborators close by and assist in a project that could advance wildlife conservation.
To prep the sensors for the snails, Dr. Blaauw’s lab added a tiny energy harvester with solar cells so the sensor could recharge its battery in the sun. They cocooned the system in epoxy to waterproof the sensor, protect it from severe light and cushion it from the rough-and-tumble life of the average snail.

They had one problem. They needed to endow the tiny computers with the power to measure light but keep the system free of large batteries that would flatten a snail. Inhee Lee, now an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Pittsburgh who was then a researcher in Dr. Blaauw’s lab, helped solve the puzzle. Dr. Lee and Dr. Blaauw simply reused the harvester, and measured the speed of its solar charge as a proxy for sunlight.

Using some invasive snails found in a Michigan garden, the researchers first tried and failed to stick the computers to the shells with magnets and Velcro until they figured out how to glue a metal nut to the surface and screw the sensor into the nut. Then the snails and their tiny passengers were ready to weather the simulated elements (buckets of water).

In August 2017, Dr. Bick and Dr. Lee arrived in Tahiti with 55 sensors. They hopped from valley to valley guided by Trevor Coote, an author on the paper and a specialist on these land snails who was based in Tahiti. (Dr. Coote died of Covid-19 in February 2021.)

Each day, the researchers tracked the snails for hours to ensure they did not escape. Occasionally, they got rained on. They did not have a permit to attach computers to the P. hyalina, which is considered endangered, so they stuck cameras directly alongside the snails, on the leaves slept on during the day, essentially tracking how much sunlight the sessile snails received. But the computer-laden rosy wolf snails proved a trickier challenge, as the mollusks were slow-moving but determined to forage (one snail absconded with a sensor for a few days).

The data revealed the sensors on P. hyalina’s habitat received, on average, 10 times as much sunlight as the rosy wolf snails did. That confirmed the researchers’ hypothesis that the bright conditions protected the pale snails from the rosy predators.

The rosy wolf snail was introduced to the Society Islands in the 1970s with the goal of controlling another invader, the giant African land snail. But the rosy wolf’s reign of terror drove many species of tree snails in the islands to extinction.

“I grew up around these environments and listened to the myths and stories featuring animals and plants that have now either gone extinct or are on the way to extinction if we do not act fast to conserve them,” said Dr. Bick, who is Pacific Islander. She added that she hoped this research supported efforts to maintain P. hyalina’s solar refuge habitats in the Society Islands.

“Most of the time, we talk about things that are dead and dying,” Dr. Bick said. “This is a story of resiliency.”"

Typically, the more risk factors that one has, the higher one’s chances are of contracting the disease in question. Arteriosclerosis also contributes to the development of hypertension, which is characterized by abnormally high blood pressure levels. The increased blood pressure attributed to hypertension can cause the hardened arteries to burst, leading to severe bleeding and even death (Schiff 183). However, one can reduce the risk of developing arteriosclerosis by reducing the level of LDL cholesterol, which is attributed to saturated fats, in one’s body. This can be accomplished by consuming foods that are rich in monounsaturated fat such as avocados, olives, and almonds, and by achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight "

In Philadelphia on Tuesday, Joe Biden gave a fiery speech, warning that American democracy is facing its greatest threat since the Civil War.
""There's an unfolding assault taking place in America today, an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote and fair and free elections,"" the president said.
Biden condemned recent efforts in 17 Republican-controlled states to pass laws curtailing when and where their citizens can vote - laws conservatives have framed as a response to allegations of voting fraud repeatedly made by Donald Trump in the months after his presidential defeat.
Many Republicans now believe the election was stolen from Trump - an assertion Biden called ""the big lie"" and one that has not been substantiated by concrete evidence.

media captionTexas Democrat: 'Republicans stripping away rights of my constituents to vote'
Meanwhile, in Texas the fight over voting changes has led to drastic measures, as Democratic legislators have temporarily blocked passage of voting legislation by flying to Washington, DC. There, they are pressuring congressional Democrats to enact new federal rules for conducting elections that would supersede any state actions.
At the centre of this national debate is a question of what is the greatest threat to American democracy. Is it the security of an election process that in 2020 relied heavily on early and mail-in voting?
Or is it a system, corrupted by the influence of big donors and powerful interests, that makes voting more difficult than necessary, particularly for historically disadvantaged groups?"
,,,,,"news, lifestyles and current affairs",,,,,,,,,"Democrats make their move
The Democratic effort at a national voting law centres around passage of the ""For the People Act"". It represents one of the most expansive federal reforms of the US election system in a generation.
The bill would guarantee that voters can receive a mail-in ballot if requested, mandate a minimum of 15 days of early voting before every federal election, require paper ballots and set standards for voting machines.
It would prohibit states from disenfranchising felons who have completed their sentences and enact new restrictions on undisclosed so-called ""dark money"" political contributions.
Many new voters would be automatically registered under the legislation, which also requires technology companies to disclose information about political advertising, create new government support for small donor-funded candidates and seek to end the practice of ""gerrymandering"" voting maps for partisan advantage.
In March the US House of Representatives approved the bill by a nearly party line vote, with one Democrat - Bennie Thompson of Mississippi - opposing because of concerns that the redistricting provision would disadvantage black voters.
Three months later, Republicans in the US Senate blocked passage of the For the People Act by use of the filibuster, a parliamentary procedure that requires 60 votes to pass major legislation. The bill only received 50 votes - all from Democrats in the evenly divided 100-seat chamber.
Democrats have since turned their focus to updating the Voting Rights Act, a 1960s-era law that has been curtailed by the US Supreme Court over the past decade.

As evidenced by the two congressional votes, Republican opposition to the Democratic legislation has been near complete.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called the bill an ""unparalleled political grab"" that would consolidate Democratic power.
""What this is really about is an effort for the federal government to take over the way we conduct elections in this country,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said shortly before his chamber blocked the bill. ""It is a solution in search of a problem.""
Former Vice-President Mike Pence, in one of his first public statements since being forced to evacuate the US Capitol after it was attacked by pro-Trump rioters, wrote in an opinion column that the Democratic proposal would ""increase opportunities for election fraud, trample the First Amendment, further erode confidence in our elections and forever dilute the votes of legally qualified eligible voters""."

Government health officials in the Netherlands say they saw a 500% spike in the number of coronavirus infections recorded this week. The sharp rise comes after the government's decision to scrap nearly all restrictions in late June, when infections were down to a few hundred a day.
The lifting of restrictions combined with the introduction of the highly contagious delta variant have caused the tremendous spike, with health officials recording nearly 52,000 new infections in the country last week.
Caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte has publicly apologized for his government's ""poor judgment."" The government reimposed a number of restrictions last week after infections hit their highest levels of the year.

Macron also ordered health care workers to get their shots by September 15 as the country struggles to fight a rise in infections that could threaten France’s economic recovery. 
He said special COVID-19 passes would be mandatory for people who want to go to restaurants, shopping malls or other public places. In order to get a pass, the person must be fully vaccinated, have a valid negative test, or carry proof that they recently recovered from COVID-19.

Robotic lifestyles
This new age corporate generation is no less than robots; perhaps they form the most advanced version of them. They exhibit extreme patterns in everyday life which ranges from extra-long working hours; disturbed sleep patterns; heavy reliance on technology; emotions, moral values and code of social conduct hitherto considered essential for human existence are no more that obsolete jargon as no one has time for such detail and lastly a continuous fatal race to achieve higher at any cost truly completes the eligibility criteria to qualify as a robot. This holds true especially for men who become totally oblivious to realities of childcare and upbringing as they are totally isolated from routine household tales.
Health Issues
The prime concern generated out of the new-age living is the rising number of lifestyle health issues which many young couples or singles face. Stress, depression, hypertension, stroke, obesity, computer vision syndromes, dry eyes, etc. Depression and stress are a direct aftermath of increased work pressures which take a heavy toll on the personal front as well. Time-starved generation doesn’t search for a health-break in a day which ultimately ends in performance dips at work which later boil down to family and hence the relations take a severe jolt. All this is the cardinal of shooting stress, temperaments, and cholesterol. Such tumultuous moods increase the incidence of alcoholism Women are now openly taking to smoking and drinks. They become more vulnerable to high-risk pregnancies or underweight babies. Also, sedentary work-days and junk food is giving rise to an obese generation.
Fractured knots
India- a homeland to rich cultures and traditions is caught-up in a whirlpool where all the entire societal fabric is reduced to a spicy new-age mix. Everything conventional has taken a comfortable. Parents do miss the company of their children but socially take pride in the feeling that their children have made it large. Marital ties are losing out to career-calls as couples don’t hesitate to value work over family-life and are happy to stay at a distance if it means greater financial bargains. Children are smart and soon become used to the new situations and accept the idea of ‘one parent at a time till it’s a weekend’. Live-ins relations a product of workaholic lifestyles where couples who fall-in for each-other but don’t want to enter into alliances they can’t support both mentally and socially. They thus, come together to lead their own personal lives while sharing some sweetness, bills and a postal address.
Mounting incomes and spending patterns
Corporate lifestyles offer extreme incomes at disposal of young minds who unlike their parents don’t mind spending exorbitantly on frivolous luxuries and pastimes. These have spiraled into a great cultural and economic divide in our societal roots. The youngsters settled in simple governmental or other private jobs don’t house both the capacity and intent to spend like their former counterparts. This is alarming in Indian scenario where the humdrum workforce forms a major chunk. Any futile attempt to copy any of the corporate cultural trait ends in a typical fiasco due to lack of exposure and funds, in addition to a ruptured monthly household budget.
Unwinding- approaches in vogue
The á la mode socializing patterns and modes have taken a heavy toll on our heritage and culture. International holidaying, social drinking, inordinate indulgence, slumber parties, page 3 soirees with professional relations etc. have become routine for the simple guy and girl for whom friends and family were supreme and indispensible on any important occasion. With virtual offices the latest entrant, these people never on a true holiday or never purely into work. They always carry the baggage of both the chores together. As a result is a 24X7 brainwork with absolutely no regard for any social or biological commitment.
The brighter side has revealed some wonderful details. The growing prowess of Corporate India has created many new avenues which are now pulling many women from unorganized to organized workforce as the incentives are alluring. This has been further boosted by the new Companies Act, which lays requisite stress on women to enter top management slots. In addition, the new Act also has highlighted the need for CSR which will surely benefit the marginalized classes. As Sheryl Sandberg quotes “I have never met a woman, or man, who stated emphatically, “Yes, I have it all.'” Because no matter what any of us has—and how grateful we are for what we have—no one has it all.” This indeed is the stark reality of the CORPORATE WORLD."

Covid-19 may have turned our lives upside down but it has certainly provided an opportunity for all of us to rise to the occasion during these testing times.

Firstly, Covid has given a huge lift to online learning both in the metros and non-metros. Online education, for instance, has got a major boost. Educational institutions, business organisations among others, have taken online education to a new level by offering classes, coaching and courses in an innovative way to keep their audience hooked at these times of lockdown. In India, students and professionals are signing up for online classes- from entrance exams like JEE and NEET or for upskilling, the demand has grown manifold. According to reports, courses on cyber security, cloud, DevOps, AI and data science have witnessed a jump of 15% in March. Several schools across the country have started online classes. Students are attending classes virtually. Schools have ensured that virtual classroom looks like normal classrooms with hours filled with activities and homework. In fact, according to Comscore, an American media measurement and analytics company that provides marketing data and analytics to enterprises; media and advertising agencies, there has been a significant jump in online news consumption across the world, communication apps are being embraced by even the cynics, and binge-watching has become the new stress buster.

Sir Richard Branson hopes to be the first billionaire to go to space aboard a ship built by his own company
Space flight company Virgin Galactic announced Thursday that founder Sir Richard Branson will attempt to beat fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos to outer space this month. This confirms rumors that have circulated since early June, when the Amazon founder said he would fly to space with an 82-year-old female pilot on July 20 on a craft designed by his aerospace company, Blue Origin.
Virgin Galactic said the British billionaire's trip aboard the company's SpaceShipTwo rocket plane was planned for July 11, pending weather and technical checks. If he succeeds, he will have beaten Bezos by nine days — making Branson the first billionaire to travel to outer space on a spacecraft built by a company he owns. 
The trip will be Virgin Galactic's fourth test spaceflight and its first mission with a crew of four aboard, up from the two pilots on its most recent spaceflight on May 22. 
""I truly believe that space belongs to all of us,"" Branson said in a press release. ""After more than 16 years of research, engineering, and testing, Virgin Galactic stands at the vanguard of a new commercial space industry, which is set to open space to humankind and change the world for good.""

Aiming higher
This billionaire space race highlights a flurry of activity taking place in the realm of space tourism, as companies seek to bring space travel to the people, or at least those who can afford it.  
Aerospace companies have provided private travel to space for years, but until now the missions have been almost entirely for purposes of science and development.
Only seven individuals have flown to space as tourists. Between 2001 and 2010, space tourism company Space Adventures facilitated tourism stays on the International Space Station (ISS), reserving travelers a spot aboard a Russian spacecraft for $20 million to $40 million (€17 million to €34 million) per seat. The pleasure trips ceased in 2010 due to increasing demand from research crews.
But the space tourism industry has developed rapidly in the last few years, with many players on the scene now in advanced stages of development.
The space travel and tourism market is expected to generate nearly $8 billion in revenue between 2020 and 2030, according to a study by space and satellite industry consultancy Northern Sky Research (NSR).

 Explainer: Who owns outer space? 
The market can be broken down into three primary types of flights on offer: orbital, suborbital, and parabolic. Orbital flights reach speeds high enough to remain in orbit around the Earth. Suborbital flights fly slower than this, reaching outer space but without the velocity to enter orbit. Parabolic flights, the most accessible of the three, take place in modified commercial jets that perform special maneuvers, coming temporarily into freefall. This replicates the feeling of weightlessness experienced in outer space without getting there.
More than 100 parabolic flights took place in 2019, with tickets for a flight running around $5,000 per person. Parabolic flights are the most accessible in terms of price and technology, although they don't actually involve entering outer space.
Unlike in the past, today the real experience is within reach. The more expensive and technically demanding orbital and suborbital flights are therefore expected to make up a combined 98% of the market until 2030. Pre-booking for these flights has shown healthy demand, while the parabolic segment has seen sluggish growth, according to NSR.
Suborbital flights take passengers outside of the Earth's atmosphere for a few minutes, where they have a view of their home planet and the sensation of weightlessness, then return to Earth a few minutes later. Trips to the ISS, which orbits the Earth, are considered orbital space flights.

A room with a view
Amazon's Blue Origin, Branson's Virgin Galactic, and Elon Musk's SpaceX are considered the frontrunners of an industry made up of more than 20 key players.
Once Bezos has completed his trip, Blue Origin plans to offer suborbital trips on the New Shepard, a traditional rocket that takes off and lands vertically. The crew capsule, located on top of the spacecraft, contains comfortable seats and massive windows designed with tourists in mind. Spots on board are to be made available for purchase to the public once Bezos has completed his flight. Prices are currently unknown, though an auction for a seat aboard Bezos' 11-minute flight sold in June for $28 million.
Virgin Galactic also aims to offer commercial suborbital flights. The company already has a long waiting list of people reserving spots on board. The total cost is still unknown, but a reservation requires a $250,000 deposit. Commercial flights are pegged to begin in 2022. Virgin Galactic plans eventually to scale up to offering 1,200 flights per year, with six seats per flight.
""The resulting economies of scale and competing technologies will lead to further downward pressure on the cost of launch — enabling an ever-increasing number of users with diverse, world-changing applications,"" the company wrote on its website.
Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic on Tuesday gave the world a virtual tour of the cabin interior of its spacecraft that would take ultra-rich passengers on suborbital trips into space. The company said that 600 people had already paid $250,000 (€213,316) each for the journey that would allow them to float weightless against the backdrop of the Earth below.

SpaceX has been more focused on testing and development than on marketing its tourism offerings. Unlike Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft can already reach low-Earth orbit. While the trips are costly, this positions SpaceX to offer the most premium experiences available right now.
Before the end of 2021, the company will launch Inspiration4, the first ""all-civilian"" mission into the Earth's orbit. Purchased by billionaire Jared Issacman, who will serve as commander, one seat on the four-person voyage is to be raffled off in a charity auction to anyone who donates more than $10. At least three other SpaceX private missions are planned for the next few years.
What to do once you get there
Brokerage firm Axiom Space is also working with SpaceX, managing the logistics of the first fully private mission to the ISS, currently planned for January 2022. A veteran astronaut will accompany three tourists on a 10-day mission that includes an eight-day stay on the space station.  Axiom plans to offer a few such flights a year, alongside its greater plan to build habitable modules connected to the ISS, what Axiom calls the world's first commercial space station.

""Everybody's building rockets, but nobody was building any destinations to go to,"" Axiom co-founder Kam Ghaffarian told CNBC in February. ""Lots of companies are building rides to space, but where are they going to go, especially when the International Space Station retires?""
The original space tourism specialists, Space Adventures, are also partnering with SpaceX to put tourists on the first fully autonomous mission to space. The trip, due to take place by early 2022, will send four individuals into high Earth orbit for five days. No trained astronaut will be onboard. A NASA report estimated that seats will cost around $55 million each.
US aviation giant Boeing also has skin in the game, having signed a deal with NASA that engages Boeing's help in developing a crew capsule called the Boeing CST-100 Starliner. In exchange, Boeing has the right to sell seats on the capsule to tourists.

The ritual of washing hands, sanitizing things before use, that started as a compulsion is becoming a habit. According to IANS C-VOTER Gallup International Association Corona

Tracker survey that was conducted recently, a mammoth 87.2 per cent of Indians have become vigilant towards their personal hygiene during Covid lockdown. Health and hygiene brands have risen to the occasion and have started massive campaigns to spread awareness on cleanliness. Public spitting is a criminal offence liable to fine.

Work from Home (WFH) is the third major change that has become a part of our lives. Well, honestly speaking it was never a new concept. Many IT companies in the West and even in India has been practicising it with perfection. Covid 19 has taken it to another level with almost all companies asking its employees to WFH.

The culture has seeped into our living rooms with people especially, women, juggling between cooking, parenting and working at the same time!

The Big Q: Will these changes continue after the lockdown is lifted? As they say, necessity is the mother of invention. A first look at these changes reveals that people from all walks of life have imbibed the alterations. Digital life has become a detox. Watching live you tube shows for hours have become popular. Similarly, people are getting used to WFH culture. According to Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, WFH will become a norm in the post-Covid world. Sanitizing things before use, is likely to continue, as people have recognized the need to stay healthy more so, with no vaccine on Covid in sight for a long time to come. Social distancing and wearing mask in public is also going to stay for a while. But then, the bigger question remains: Is India’s infrastructure well equipped to sustain these changes when things normalize? More important, will these changes enhance our economy or infuse more trouble in terms of employment? The answer lies in how things will shape up in few months. Till then, it’s wait and watch."

FULL STORY
A new model tracking the vertical movement of algae-covered microplastic particles offers hope in the fight against plastic waste in our oceans.

Research led by Newcastle University's Dr Hannah Kreczak is the first to identify the processes that underpin the trajectories of microplastics below the ocean surface. Publishing their findings in the journal Limnology and Oceanography the authors analysed how biofouling -- the accumulation of algae on the surface of microplastics, impacts the vertical movement of buoyant particles.

The researchers found that particle properties are the biggest factor in determining the period and characteristics of the repetitive vertical movement below the surface, while the algal population dynamics determine the maximum depth reached. Their findings also show that the smallest particles are extremely sensitive to algal cell attachment and growth, suggesting they are always submerged at depths surrounding the base of the euphotic zone, the layer closer to the surface that receives enough light to support photosynthesis, or could become trapped in large algal colonies.

In general, the results suggest that a higher concentration of biofouled microplastic is expected to be found subsurface, close to the euphotic zone depth rather than at the ocean's surface.

Microplastics (fragments with a diameter smaller than 5mm) make up 90% of the plastic debris found at the ocean surface and the amount of plastic entering our ocean is significantly larger than the estimates of floating plastic on the surface of the ocean. However, it is not exactly known what happens to these particles once they enter the ocean, and 99% of microplastics within our ocean are considered missing.

This new model has the potential to understand the distribution of fouled plastics in the ocean and therefore the ecological impact, particularly in areas of high concentration.

Dr Hannah Kreczak, EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellow at Newcastle University's School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, said: ""Mathematical modelling has been extremely beneficial in identifying hot-spots for marine plastic pollution on the ocean surface. I hope this research can be a constructive step in understanding the impact plastic pollution has below the surface and aid in the effort towards a more sustainable ocean.""

Co-Author Dr Andrew Baggaley, Lecturer in Applied Mathematics at the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, added: ""This is an exciting first step in our project to develop a comprehensive modelling framework to understand the transport of microplastic particles and their distribution in the oceans.""

Future research by the team will focus on the fluid motion in the ocean mixed layer, to allow for even more complete assessment of microplastic vertical distributions in the ocean.

Summary:
A scientific team has shown that the release of neurotransmitters in the brain is impaired in patients with schizophrenia who have a rare, single-gene mutation known to predispose people to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders.

FULL STORY
A scientific team has shown that the release of neurotransmitters in the brain is impaired in patients with schizophrenia who have a rare, single-gene mutation known to predispose people to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Significantly, the results from the research with human-derived neurons validated previous and new experiments that found the same major decrease in neurotransmitter release and synaptic signaling in genetically engineered human neurons with the same genetic variant -- the deletion of neurexin 1 (NRXN1). NRXN1 is a protein-coding gene at the synapse, a cellular junction that connects two nerve cells to communicate efficiently.

Both the research with human-derived and engineered human neurons also found an increase in the levels of CASK, an NRXN1-binding protein, which were associated with changes in gene expression.

""Losing one copy of this neurexin 1 gene somehow contributes to the etiology or the disease mechanism in these schizophrenia patients,"" says molecular neuroscientist ChangHui Pak, assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and lead author of the research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""It causes a deficit in neural communication.""

Pak is quick to add that although this single-gene mutation puts people at risk for schizophrenia, autism, Tourette syndrome and other neuropsychiatric disorders, ""at the end of the day, we don't know what causes schizophrenia. This variant gives us insight into what cellular pathways would be perturbed among people with schizophrenia and a lead to study this biology.""

When she conducted most of the research, Pak was working in the Stanford University lab of Thomas Südhof, a neuroscientist who shared the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for helping to lay the molecular basis for brain chemistry, including neurotransmitter release.

The research team obtained cell specimens from schizophrenia patients with an NRXN1 deletion who donated samples to a national biorepository for genetic studies of psychiatric disorders. Pak and colleagues converted the participants' specimens into stem cells and then turned them into functional neurons to study. ""We're rewinding these cells back, almost like a time machine -- what did these patients' brains look like early on,"" Pak explains.

Labs at Stanford, Rutgers University and FUJIFILM Cellular Dynamics were independently involved in the generation and analysis of neurons. For comparison with the human-derived neurons, Pak and team also created human neurons from embryonic stem cells, engineering them to have one less copy of the NRXN1 gene. With engineered human neurons, they had previously noted the neurotransmitter impairment and were interested in whether they would have the same findings with patient-derived neurons.

""It was good to see the consistent biological finding that indeed the neurexin 1 deletion in these patients actually does mess up their neuronal synaptic communication, and secondly that this is reproducible across different sites whoever does the experiment,"" Pak says.

Notably, the researchers did not see the same decrease in neurotransmitter release and other effects in engineered mouse neurons with analogous NRXN1 deletion. ""What this suggests is there is a human-specific component to this phenotype. The human neurons are particularly vulnerable to this genetic insult, compared to other organisms, adding to the value of studying human mutations in human cellular systems,"" Pak says.

Being able to reproduce the results is key to the development of drugs that can better treat schizophrenia. ""Everything was done blindly and at different sites. We wanted to not only learn about the biology but also be at the top of our game to ensure rigor and reproducibility of these findings,"" Pak says. ""We showed the field how this can be done.""

Pak and her team are now continuing the research in the Pak Lab, supported by a five-year, $2.25 million grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. The scientists are using the latest stem cell and neuroscience methodologies to explore the molecular basis of synaptic dysfunction in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Summary:
A recent study defines a mechanistic role for an understudied bacteria family in gynecologic disease.
Share:
    
FULL STORY
Bacterial vaginosis is the most common and recurrent gynecological condition affecting nearly 30% of women between the ages of 15 and 44, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A University of Arizona Health Sciences-led study recently identified a specific bacteria family and uncovered how it contributes to bacterial vaginosis, paving the way for new insights into disease prevention and treatment.

Led by Melissa Herbst-Kralovetz, PhD, a member of the BIO5 Institute and associate professor of basic medical sciences at the College of Medicine -- Phoenix, researchers found that members of the Veillonellaceae bacteria family contribute to an increase in inflammation and cell death, and alter the acidity of the cervical microenvironment. These changes support bacterial vaginosis and create favorable conditions for subsequent gynecological diseases, such as sexually transmitted infections and cancer.

""Bacterial vaginosis is an enigma,"" said Dr. Herbst-Kralovetz, who is also director of the Women's Health Research Program. ""We know many factors contribute to this disease, but little is known about the functional impact of the major players and how they're changing the local landscape.""

The paper, ""Veillonellaceae family members uniquely alter the cervical metabolic microenvironment in a human three-dimensional epithelial model,"" published July 6 in the journal npj Biofilms and Microbiomes, found that Veillonellaceae family members contribute to disease by altering inflammation and metabolism in the cervicovaginal region.

The female reproductive tract is typically colonized by bacteria that promote health, such as Lactobacillus. While these bacteria are considered friendly, an imbalance can lead to the creation of a biofilm -- a consortium of many different harmful microbes -- that promotes disease.

Last year, Dr. Herbst-Kralovetz and colleagues described a hypothetical model in which the interactions between microbes and human cells alter the vaginal microenvironment and ultimately influence the balance between health and disease. This study is the first to define a definitive role for this bacterial family in bacterial vaginosis.

Using a 3D human model, Dr. Herbst-Kralovetz's group evaluated the effects of three bacterium -- Veillonella atypica, Veillonella montpellierensis, and Megasphaera micronuciformis -- on the cervical microenvironment.

They found that two species -- V. atypica and V. montpellierensis -- decreased lactate, an acid typically produced by beneficial bacteria that provides protection from harmful infections. These two species also increased substances that play a role in bacterial vaginosis-associated vaginal odor.

They also found that M. micronuciformis further drives disease progression by increasing inflammation and promoting cell death through the production of certain fat molecules.

Insights from this study lay the foundation for polymicrobial, or ""multi-bug"" studies, which can determine the complex interaction effects of multiple bacterial species on female reproductive health.

""Using this study and our 3D model as a foundation, we hope to determine if and how other species are altering the environment to contribute to bacterial vaginosis,"" Dr. Herbst-Kralovetz said. ""We have found that different species have distinct contributions, so we also hope to categorize a variety of bacterial vaginosis -associated microbes based on their unique effects on the female reproductive tract.""

Ultimately, Dr. Herbst-Kralovetz says this study and others like it can help to inform treatment and intervention strategies.

""It is important to know who the major players are, but also how they're influencing physiological processes and disease, so we can develop targeted strategies to treat bacterial vaginosis and prevent subsequent gynecological infections and cancer,"" she said.

Dr. Herbst-Kralovatz's co-authors from the College of Medicine -- Phoenix are Jason Maarsingh, PhD, a postdoctoral research assistant in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Pawel Laniewski, PhD, an assistant research scientist in the Department of Basic Medical Sciences. Other co-authors include undergraduate student Camryn Garza and Mary Salliss, who participated in the Bath University Placement/Exchange Program.

The study was funded in part by the National Cancer Institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health, and a supplement from the Office of Research for Women's Health (3P30CA023074-39S3), and the Flinn Foundation (2244)."
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"A decade after scientists discovered that lab rats will rescue a fellow rat in distress, but not a rat they consider an outsider, new research from the University of California, Berkeley, pinpoints the brain regions that drive rats to prioritize their nearest and dearest in times of crisis. It also suggests humans may share the same neural bias.

The findings, published today, Tuesday, July 13, in the journal eLife, suggest that altruism, whether in rodents or humans, is motivated by social bonding and familiarity rather than sympathy or guilt.

""We have found that the group identity of the distressed rat dramatically influences the neural response and decision to help, revealing the biological mechanism of ingroup bias,"" said study senior author Daniela Kaufer, a professor of neuroscience and integrative biology at UC Berkeley.

With nativism and conflicts between religious, ethnic and racial groups on the rise globally, the results suggest that social integration, rather than segregation, may boost cooperation among humans.

""Priming a common group membership may be a more powerful driver for inducing pro-social motivation than increasing empathy,"" said study lead author Inbal Ben-Ami Bartal, an assistant professor of psychobiology at Tel-Aviv University in Israel.

Bartal launched the study in 2014 as a postdoctoral Miller fellow in Kaufer's laboratory at UC Berkeley. Bartal, Kaufer and UC Berkeley psychology professor Dacher Keltner led a research team that sought to identify the brain networks activated in rats in response to empathy, and whether they are mirrored in humans. The results suggest they are.

""The finding of a similar neural network involved in empathic helping in rats, as in humans, provides new evidence that caring for others is based on a shared neurobiological mechanism across mammals,"" Bartal said.

Using fiber photometry, immunohistochemistry, calcium imaging and other diagnostic tools, researchers found that all the rats they studied experienced empathy in response to another rat's signs of distress.

However, to act on that empathy, the helper rat's neural reward circuitry had to be triggered, and that only occurred if the trapped rat was of the same type as the helper rat, or member of its ingroup.

""Surprisingly, we found that the network associated with empathy is activated when you see a distressed peer, whether they are in the ingroup or not,"" Kaufer said. ""In contrast, the network associated with reward signaling was active only for ingroup members and correlated with helping behavior.""

Specifically, the rats' empathy correlated with the brain's sensory and orbitofrontal regions, as well as with the anterior insula. Meanwhile, the rodents' decision to help was linked to activity in the nucleus accumbens, a reward center with neurotransmitters that include dopamine and serotonin.

For the study, more than 60 pairs of caged rats were monitored over the course of two weeks. Some of the pairs were of the same strain or genetic tribe while others were not.

In each trial, one rat would be trapped inside a transparent cylinder while the other roamed free in a larger enclosure surrounding the cylinder.

While unconstrained rats consistently signaled empathy in response to the plight of trapped rats, they only worked to free those that were part of their ingroup, in which case they would lean or butt their heads against the cage door to release the rat.

Indeed, in reviewing the results of multiple measures to understand the neural roots of that bias, the research team found that while all the rodents in the trials sensed their cage partner's distress, their brains' reward circuitry was only activated when they came to the rescue of a member of their ingroup.

Moreover, humans and other mammals share virtually the same empathy and reward regions in the brain, implying that we may have similar biases toward our ingroup when it comes to helping others, Bartal noted.

""Overall, the findings suggest that empathy alone doesn't predict helping behavior, and that's really a crucial point,"" she said. ""So, if you want to motivate people to help others who are suffering, it may be that you have to increase their feeling of belonging and group membership, and work toward a common identity.""

""Encouragingly,"" she added, ""we find that this mechanism is very flexible and determined primarily by social experience. We will now try to understand how pro-social motivation shifts when rats become friends, and how that is reflected in their brain activity."""
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,," Astronomers see many periodic emissions from space, typically caused by rotation of stars and often very regular. Astrophysicists noticed a unique periodicity in the soft gamma ray emissions from a magnetar located in our galaxy. The soft gamma repeater SGR1935+2154 appears to emit bursts only within regularly spaced windows, and is inactive in between. Based on their analysis, they predicted a resumption of bursts last month; so far, a dozen have been detected.

Magnetars are bizarre objects -- massive, spinning neutron stars with magnetic fields among the most powerful known, capable of shooting off brief bursts of radio waves so bright they're visible across the universe.

A team of astrophysicists has now found another peculiarity of magnetars: They can emit bursts of low energy gamma rays in a pattern never before seen in any other astronomical object.

It's unclear why this should be, but magnetars themselves are poorly understood, with dozens of theories about how they produce radio and gamma ray bursts. The recognition of this unusual pattern of gamma ray activity could help theorists figure out the mechanisms involved.

""Magnetars, which are connected with fast radio bursts and soft gamma repeaters, have something periodic going on, on top of randomness,"" said astrophysicist Bruce Grossan, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL). ""This is another mystery on top of the mystery of how the bursts are produced.""

The researchers -- Grossan and theoretical physicist and cosmologist Eric Linder from UC Berkeley and postdoctoral fellow Mikhail Denissenya from Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan -- discovered the pattern in bursts from a soft gamma repeater, SGR1935+2154, that is a magnetar, a prolific source of soft or lower energy gamma ray bursts and the only known source of fast radio bursts within our Milky Way galaxy. They found that the object emits bursts randomly, but only within regular four-month windows of time, each active window separated by three months of inactivity.

On March 19, the team uploaded a preprint claiming ""periodic windowed behavior"" in soft gamma bursts from SGR1935+2154 and predicted that these bursts would start up again after June 1 -- following a three month hiatus -- and could occur throughout a four-month window ending Oct. 7.

On June 24, three weeks into the window of activity, the first new burst from SGR1935+2154 was observed after the predicted three month gap, and nearly a dozen more bursts have been observed since, including one on July 6, the day the paper was published online in the journal Physical Review D.

""These new bursts within this window means that our prediction is dead on,"" said Grossan, who studies high energy astronomical transients. ""Probably more important is that no bursts were detected between the windows since we first published our preprint.""

Linder likens the non-detection of bursts in three-month windows to a key clue -- the ""curious incident"" that a guard dog did not bark in the nighttime -- that allowed Sherlock Holmes to solve a murder in the short story ""The Adventure of Silver Blaze.""

""Missing or occasional data is a nightmare for any scientist,"" noted Denissenya, the first author of the paper and a member of the Energetic Cosmos Laboratory at Nazarbayev University that was founded several years ago by Grossan, Linder and UC Berkeley cosmologist and Nobel laureate George Smoot. ""In our case, it was crucial to realize that missing bursts or no bursts at all carry information.""

The confirmation of their prediction startled and thrilled the researchers, who think this may be a novel example of a phenomenon -- periodic windowed behavior -- that could characterize emissions from other astronomical objects.

Mining data from 27-year-old satellite

Within the last year, researchers suggested that the emission of fast radio bursts -- which typically last a few thousandths of a second -- from distant galaxies might be clustered in a periodic windowed pattern. But the data were intermittent, and the statistical and computational tools to firmly establish such a claim with sparse data were not well developed.

Grossan convinced Linder to explore whether advanced techniques and tools could be used to demonstrate that periodically windowed -- but random, as well, within an activity window -- behavior was present in the soft gamma ray burst data of the SGR1935+2154 magnetar. The Konus instrument aboard the WIND spacecraft, launched in 1994, has recorded soft gamma ray bursts from that object -- which also exhibits fast radio bursts -- since 2014 and likely never missed a bright one.

Linder, a member of the Supernova Cosmology Project based at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, had used advanced statistical techniques to study the clustering in space of galaxies in the universe, and he and Denissenya adapted these techniques to analyze the clustering of bursts in time. Their analysis, the first to use such techniques for repeated events, showed an unusual windowed periodicity distinct from the very precise repetition produced by bodies rotating or in orbit, which most astronomers think of when they think of periodic behavior.

""So far, we have observed bursts over 10 windowed periods since 2014, and the probability is 3 in 10,000 that while we think it is periodic windowed, it is actually random,"" he said, meaning there's a 99.97% chance they're right. He noted that a Monte Carlo simulation indicated that the chance they're seeing a pattern that isn't really there is likely well under 1 in a billion.

The recent observation of five bursts within their predicted window, seen by WIND and other spacecraft monitoring gamma ray bursts, adds to their confidence. However, a single future burst observed outside the window would disprove the whole theory, or cause them to redo their analysis completely.

""The most intriguing and fun part for me was to make predictions that could be tested in the sky. We then ran simulations against real and random patterns and found it really did tell us about the bursts,"" Denissenya said.

As for what causes this pattern, Grossan and Linder can only guess. Soft gamma ray bursts from magnetars are thought to involve starquakes, perhaps triggered by interactions between the neutron star's crust and its intense magnetic field. Magnetars rotate once every few seconds, and if the rotation is accompanied by a precession -- a wobble in the rotation -- that might make the source of burst emission point to Earth only within a certain window. Another possibility, Grossan said, is that a dense, rotating cloud of obscuring material surrounds the magnetar but has a hole that only periodically allows bursts to come out and reach Earth.

""At this stage of our knowledge of these sources, we can't really say which it is,"" Grossan said. ""This is a rich phenomenon that will likely be studied for some time.""

Linder agrees and points out that the advances were made by the cross-pollination of techniques from high energy astrophysics observations and theoretical cosmology.

""UC Berkeley is a great place where diverse scientists can come together,"" he said. ""They will continue to watch and learn and even 'listen' with their instruments for more dogs in the night.""

Children exposed to elevated levels of air pollution may be more likely to have poor inhibitory control during late childhood and poor academic skills in early adolescence, including spelling, reading comprehension, and math skills. Difficulty with inhibition in late childhood was found to be a precursor to later air pollution-related academic problems. Interventions that target inhibitory control might improve outcomes.

Results of the study by researchers at the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and Columbia University Irving Medical Center are published in the journal Environmental Research.

""Children with poor inhibitory control are less able to override a common response in favor of a more unusual one -- such as the natural response to say 'up' when an arrow is facing up or 'go' when a light is green -- and instead say 'down' or 'stop,'"" says first author Amy Margolis, PhD, associate professor of medical psychology in the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. ""By compromising childhood inhibitory control, prenatal exposure to air pollution may alter the foundation upon which later academic skills are built.""

""When evaluating student's learning problems and formulating treatment plans, parents and teachers should consider that academic problems related to environmental exposures may require intervention focused on inhibitory control problems, rather than on content-related skill deficits, as is typical in interventions designed to address learning disabilities,"" Margolis adds.

""This study adds to a growing body of literature showing the deleterious health effects of prenatal exposure to air pollution on child health outcomes, including academic achievement,"" says co-author Julie Herbstman, PhD, CCCEH director and associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia Mailman School. ""Reducing levels of air pollution may prevent these adverse outcomes and lead to improvements in children's academic achievement.""

The new findings align with prior Columbia research finding a DNA marker for PAH exposure was associated with altered development of self-regulatory capacity and ADHD symptoms.

The study followed 200 children enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study in Northern Manhattan and the Bronx led by CCCEH researchers. Researchers collected measures of prenatal airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH, a major component of air pollution) during the third trimester of pregnancy, a period when the fetus is highly vulnerable to environmental insults. Tests of inhibitory control were administered at or around age 10 and tests of academic achievement, at or around age 13.

Inhibitory Control and Learning

When students learn new concepts, they often need to override a previous habit in order to incorporate a new rule into a skill. For example, when learning to read a vowel a child will learn that the letter a has a short vowel sound ""a as in apple"" but a long sound when the consonant is followed by a ""magic e,"" as in ""rate."""
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"Are silver nanoparticles a silver bullet against microbes?
Antimicrobials are used to kill or slow the growth of bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms. They can be in the form of antibiotics, used to treat bodily infections, or as an additive or coating on commercial products used to keep germs at bay. These life-saving tools are essential to preventing and treating infections in humans, animals and plants, but they also pose a global threat to public health when microorganisms develop resistance to them, a concept known as antimicrobial resistance.

One of the main drivers of antimicrobial resistance is the misuse and overuse of antimicrobial agents, which includes silver nanoparticles, an advanced material with well-documented antimicrobial properties. It is increasingly used in commercial products that boast enhanced germ-killing performance -- it has been woven into textiles, coated onto toothbrushes, and even mixed into cosmetics as a preservative.

The Gilbertson Group at the University of Pittsburgh Swanson School of Engineering used laboratory strains of E.coli to better understand bacterial resistance to silver nanoparticles and attempt to get ahead of the potential misuse of this material. The team recently published their results in Nature Nanotechnology.

""Bacterial resistance to silver nanoparticles is understudied, so our group looked at the mechanisms behind this event,"" said Lisa Stabryla, lead author on the paper and a recent civil and environmental PhD graduate at Pitt. ""This is a promising innovation to add to our arsenal of antimicrobials, but we need to consciously study it and perhaps regulate its use to avoid decreased efficacy like we've seen with some common antibiotics.""

Stabryla exposed E.coli to 20 consecutive days of silver nanoparticles and monitored bacterial growth over time. Nanoparticles are roughly 50 times smaller than a bacterium.

""In the beginning, bacteria could only survive at low concentrations of silver nanoparticles, but as the experiment continued, we found that they could survive at higher doses,"" Stabryla noted. ""Interestingly, we found that bacteria developed resistance to the silver nanoparticles but not their released silver ions alone.""

The group sequenced the genome of the E.coli that had been exposed to silver nanoparticles and found a mutation in a gene that corresponds to an efflux pump that pushes heavy metal ions out of the cell.

""It is possible that some form of silver is getting into the cell, and when it arrives, the cell mutates to quickly pump it out,"" she added. ""More work is needed to determine if researchers can perhaps overcome this mechanism of resistance through particle design.""

The group then studied two different types of E.coli: a hyper-motile strain that swims through its environment more quickly than normally motile bacteria and a non-motile strain that does not have physical means for moving around. They found that only the hyper-motile strain developed resistance.

""This finding could suggest that silver nanoparticles may be a good option to target certain types of bacteria, particularly non-motile strains,"" Stabryla said.

In the end, bacteria will still find a way to evolve and evade antimicrobials. The hope is that an understanding of the mechanisms that lead to this evolution and a mindful use of new antimicrobials will lessen the impact of antimicrobial resistance.

""We are the first to look at bacterial motility effects on the ability to develop resistance to silver nanoparticles,"" said Leanne Gilbertson, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Pitt. ""The observed difference is really interesting and merits further investigation to understand it and how to link the genetic response -- the efflux pump regulation -- to the bacteria's ability to move in the system.

""The results are promising for being able to tune particle properties for a desired response, such as high efficacy while avoiding resistance."""
,,,,,"news, lifestyles and current affairs",,,,,,,,,"News is important for a number of reasons within a society. Mainly to inform the public about events that are around them and may affect them. 

Often news is for entertainment purposes too; to provide a distraction of information about other places people are unable to get to or have little influence over. News can make people feel connected too.

News is important as a social gathering space too, hence newspapers either online or physical place an emphasis on news. Where there are a lot of people gathered there is opportunity to advertise. This advertising sometimes can cause a conflict of interest in the way news is reported.Importance of local news

News from a local area is often important to advise people in a locality about activities that may have an impact on a community. This can allow a community to engage in decision making processes in a community. For example if a local community reports on a dangerous road or accident hotspot reporting these can be later used as evidence to lobby for funding to fix a problem.

Importance of national news

Often countries have a broad extent of distance and in some cases differing time zones.  Having a national news focus can allow people to gain a sense of national perspective. This is particularly significant for countries that have a diverse range of population centres such as cities or towns. For example large cities many thousands of kilometres apart may still rely on each other for trade or resources of economic significance. So knowing the situations in other cities and towns becomes important.

Importance of international news

News from one country to another is important in todays global economy. Knowing what is happening in other countries gives people a perspective of each others ways of life and cultural differences.  Certain kinds of news from countries that rely on each other for energy or other resources can often have a profound influence in overall global economics. "

A modern newspaper cov­ers nearly every sphere of human activity. Such, for instance, are the economic question, education, letters, business, poli­tics, the theatre, radio, cinema and sport. Hence its popular­ity is anything but on the wane.

Again, the common man requires an agreeable respite from the humdrum occupations of his daily work. I am not here referring to those jobless and unoccupied, but to those who are engrossed or occupied (and perhaps even preoccupied) with business from that of a Cabinet Minister to that of a doctor or clerk. That is why the newspaper is welcome, inasmuch as it provides its reader with a diversity of topics to rest his mind or raise his spirits, perhaps with a pint of Beachcomber. Light skits, causeries, teasers, crossword competitions, short stories, humorous sketches and what not will go a long way to alleviate the ennui of his daily grind. These and other squibs will act as safety-valves to his sanity and happiness.
And again, newspapers help the common man to form his own opinions about politics, economics and the social aspects of life. Such matters are not always as simple as may appear on the surface. Here the editors of the Press have an important mission in forming and guiding the average reader’s outlook. In fact, we can often tell the paper a man regularly reads from the opinions he voices. Even cultured men do not consider it beneath their dignity to peruse the outstanding dailies of today; they are convinced that mod­ern editors have something to say and know how to say it.

But that is not all. Inevitably, every big newspaper worth its salt is, consciously or unconsciously, colored by its own definite policy. The regular reader of any one such paper is thereby influenced, and oftentimes biased, in his opinions and convictions. Not that it matters, really; but big newspa­pers certainly have a responsibility here. They may at times not provide their readers with all the implications of, say, some political squabble: the attitude of America towards Russia. Hence more scope for longer articles may be desir­able.

Finally, many people today are interested in technical matters. Here the Press steps in to guide and instruct the reader about electrical and mechanical devices: radios, motors, gardening, shopping, travelling. Above all, the mod­ern newspaper must see that the articles it publishes do not arraign the advertisements it boosts nor deal in dishonesty. That would lower its prestige and following. People are not fools; they are quick to discern the cheap from the genuine."

There are daily and weekly newspapers. There are also morning and evening editions of the same newspapers. They provide us with all kinds of news. They cater for all kinds of tastes. Sports’ lovers have a sports page; business men will scan the advertisements. Those who are politically minded will read all those articles pertaining to the government and its policies. Some read only the headlines and the editorial.

The newspaper is an important medium of advertising. Those who have goods or services to sell will advertise them in newspapers. Thus they will be able to reach a large number of consumers or clients. A newspaper is important also because it helps to educate the public. People can keep in touch with notable events both at home and abroad. It also shapes public opinion. The views expressed by the editor make people think and form their own opinion. If there is some glaring injustice or if the policies of the government are faulty, the newspapers will expose them. They will arouse public sentiment against such grievances. So newspapers play an important role in moulding and rousing public opinion in a free country.
The press is free to attack the government policies only in a free country like ours which is a democracy. If a country is not free, the press is gagged. Everything that is published in newspapers is censored by the government. This means that no one can speak the truth or criticise the government.

,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"New pain research finds what you say in the first minute after a vaccine can be key in reducing a child's distress. As we look forward to a fall with hopefully one of the most important vaccination uptakes of children in a generation, a new study provides insights to help parents with reducing post-vaccination distress in younger kids. The study, published in PAIN, looked at preschool children who were at least four-to-five years old and what their parents said that could help reduce distress during their vaccination. This study is part of the largest study in the world looking at caregivers and children during vaccinations from birth to the age of five -- coined the OUCH Cohort. The OUCH Cohort originally followed 760 caregiver-child dyads from three pediatric clinics in the Greater Toronto Area and were observed during vaccinations during the first five years of a child's life.

""What we found is that in the first minute after the needle, the more parents said coping-promoting statements, such as 'you can do this' and 'it will be over soon' or tried to distract them with talking about something else, the higher distressed the children were. This really surprised us,"" said Rebecca Pillai Riddell, senior author, professor in the department of psychology, Faculty of Health and Director at the OUCH Lab at York University. ""We found however, during the second minute after the vaccine, when the child was calmer, these same coping promoting statements resulted in them calming down faster. On the other hand, distress-promoting statements, such as criticizing the child, or reassuring them they were fine, had no relationship with child distress in minute-one but and in minute-two, the distress-promoting comments were strongly predictive of higher distress in kids. We also showed with preschoolers that the more distressed they were prior to the needle, the more distressed they were after the needle -- like a domino effect of previous pain.""

""Previous research has shown that the vast majority of preschoolers calm down within two minutes after a vaccination, however, about 25 per cent of children did not. We wanted to determine what parents were saying before or during the vaccination appointment that could be leading to these children feeling distressed during and after a vaccination,"" said Ilana Shiff, first author and master's student in Pillai Riddell's lab.

Based on their findings, the researchers recommend that in first minute after a vaccine parents should not start encouraging coping right away, but rather keep them calm by using physical strategies such as hugging, cuddling or hand-holding. This should be done instead of trying to give a child verbal direction on how to cope when they are in peak distress. Once children get over that initial minute of high distress, Pillai Riddell says, they think children are more able to get benefit from parents' coping-promoting statements. The findings also provide insight for health-care providers and caregivers on how to support children during immunization appointments.

Researchers say because preschool children show the prior pain 'domino-effect,' it is critical for health-care providers to try to vaccinate calm preschoolers. Routinely adopting techniques that allow the child to be approached without distressing them prior to the needle (e.g., allowing a child to stay close to their caregiver while viewing a video on a smartphone as a distraction) will help minimize the pain 'domino effect' these findings suggest. Moreover, for both groups, supporting caregivers to avoid distress-promoting behaviours before and during the vaccination will be critical.

""This type of data has never been found in preschoolers before. It's important to understand post-needle reactions at this age because needle phobia and phobias in general start coming on at five to 10 years of age, so understanding how children can be coached and how parents can have a really powerful role in reducing stress post a vaccination is key,"" said Pillai Riddell.

,,,,,"scientific development
education",,,,,,,,,"North Carolina State University researchers have created insecticide-free, mosquito-resistant clothing using textile materials they confirmed to be bite-proof in experiments with live mosquitoes. They developed the materials using a computational model of their own design, which describes the biting behavior of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that carries viruses that cause human diseases like Zika, Dengue fever and yellow fever.

Ultimately, the researchers reported in the journal Insects that they were able to prevent 100 percent of bites when a volunteer wore their clothing -- a base layer undergarment and a combat shirt initially designed for the military -- in a cage with 200 live, disease-free mosquitoes. Vector Textiles, an NC State startup company, has licensed the related patent rights and intends to make clothing for commercial sale in the United States.

The researchers think their computational model could be used more widely to develop clothing to reduce transmission of diseases.

""The fabric is proven to work -- that's the great thing we discovered,"" said study co-author Andre West, associate professor of fashion and textile design at NC State and director of Zeis Textiles Extension for Economic Development. ""To me, that's revolutionary. We found we can prevent the mosquito from pushing through the fabric, while others were thick enough to prevent it from reaching the skin.""

To develop the computational model to design textile materials that could prevent A. aegypti bites, researchers investigated the dimensions of the head, antenna and mouth of A. aegypti, and the mechanics of how it bites. Then, they used the model to predict textile materials that would prevent bites, depending on their thickness and pore size. Researchers said they believe the materials could be effective against other mosquito species in addition to A. aegypti because of similarities in biology and biting behavior.

""There are different uses for clothing,"" said the study's first author Kun Luan, postdoctoral research scholar of forest biomaterials at NC State. ""The idea is to have a model that will cover all possible garments that a person would ever want.""

To test the accuracy of their model, the researchers tested the materials predicted to be bite-proof. In experiments with live, disease-free mosquitoes, the researchers surrounded a blood reservoir with plastic materials made according to parameters predicted by the model. They then counted how many mosquitoes became engorged with blood.

One material they initially tested was very thin -- less than one millimeter thick -- but had a very small pore size to prevent the mosquito from sticking its mouth parts, or proboscis, through the material. Another material had a medium pore size to prevent the mosquito from inserting its head through the textile far enough to reach the skin; and a third material had larger pores, but was sufficiently thick that the mosquito's mouth still couldn't reach the skin.

In a subsequent test, the researchers chose a series of knitted and woven fabrics that met the bite-proof parameters determined by the model, and validated they worked in experiments using both the blood reservoir and human volunteers. The researchers tested the number of bites received by volunteers when study participants inserted an arm covered by a protective sleeve into a mosquito cage. The researchers also compared the fabrics' ability to prevent bites and repel mosquitoes to fabrics treated with an insecticide.

From what they learned in early experiments, researchers developed the bite-resistant, form-fitting undergarment made with a thin material, as well as a long-sleeved shirt, which was initially envisioned as a combat shirt for the military.

When a volunteer wore the garments sitting for 10 minutes and standing for 10 minutes in a walk-in cage with 200 hungry mosquitos, the volunteer found the combat shirt was 100 percent effective at preventing bites. In the first trial testing the base layer, the volunteer received bites on the back and shoulders -- seven bites for 200 mosquitoes. The researchers attributed the bites to the fabric stretching and deforming, so they doubled the material layer around the shoulders, and were ultimately able to prevent 100 percent of bites. They also tested the clothing for comfort, and to see how well it trapped heat and released moisture.

""The final garments that were produced were 100 percent bite-resistant,"" said Michael Roe, William Neal Reynolds Distinguished Professor of Entomology at NC State. ""Everyday clothing you wear in the summer is not bite-resistant to mosquitoes. Our work has shown that it doesn't have to be that way. Clothes that you wear every day can be made bite-resistant. Ultimately, the idea is to have a model that will cover all possible garments that person would ever want -- both for the military as well as for private use.""

,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"Humans have known for over two thousand years that shipworms, a worm-like mollusk, are responsible for damage to wooden boats, docks, dikes and piers. Yet new research from the University of Massachusetts Amherst published in Frontiers in Microbiology reveals that we still don't know the most basic thing about them: how they eat.

""It's unbelievable,"" says Reuben Shipway, adjunct assistant professor in microbiology at UMass Amherst, research fellow at the Centre for Enzyme Innovation at the University of Portsmouth, UK, and one of the paper's authors. ""The ancient Greeks wrote about them, Christopher Columbus lost his fleet due to what he called 'the havoc which the worm had wrought,' and, today, shipworms cause billions of dollars of damage a year.""

Shipworms also play a key role in mangrove forest ecosystems, found throughout the world's tropical regions, and are responsible for cycling a huge amount of carbon through the web of life. ""Yet,"" says Shipway, ""we still don't know how they do what they do.""

Part of the problem is that the nutritious part of wood -- cellulose -- is encased in a thick and extremely difficult-to-digest layer of lignin. ""Imagine a really thick, unbreakable eggshell,"" says senior author and UMass professor of microbiology, Barry Goodell.

Certain fungi possess enzymes capable of digesting the lignin, and it has long been thought that symbiotic bacteria living in shipworms' gills also had the enzymes. ""We thought that the bacteria were doing the work,"" says Goodell, ""but we now know they are not.""

Researchers are still trying to figure out what within the shipworm could be responsible for breaking down the lignin. ""I combed through the entire genomes of five different species of shipworm,"" says Stefanos Stravoravdis, the paper's lead author and a graduate student in microbiology at UMass, ""looking for specific protein groups which create the enzymes that we know are capable of digesting lignin. My search turned up nothing.""

This, however, is not the end of the story, and the team will be publishing more research in the near future that will help unravel the mystery of how shipworms eat wood. ""We need to understand this process"" says Stravoravdis.

,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"This device harvests power from your sweaty fingertips while you sleep
Researchers have developed a new device that harvests energy from the sweat on -- of all places -- your fingertips. To date, the device is believed to be the most efficient on-body energy harvester ever invented, producing 300 millijoules (mJ) of energy per square centimeter without any mechanical energy input during a 10-hour sleep and an additional 30 mJ of energy with a single press of a finger.
Feeling extra sweaty from a summer heat wave? Don't worry -- not all your perspiration has to go to waste. In a paper publishing July 13 in the journal Joule, researchers have developed a new device that harvests energy from the sweat on -- of all places -- your fingertips. To date, the device is the most efficient on-body energy harvester ever invented, producing 300 millijoules (mJ) of energy per square centimeter without any mechanical energy input during a 10-hour sleep and an additional 30 mJ of energy with a single press of a finger. The authors say the device represents a significant step forward for self-sustainable wearable electronics.

""Normally, you want maximum return on investment in energy. You don't want to expend a lot of energy through exercise to get only a little energy back,"" says senior author Joseph Wang (@JWangnano), a nanoengineering professor at the University of California San Diego. ""But here, we wanted to create a device adapted to daily activity that requires almost no energy investment -- you can completely forget about the device and go to sleep or do desk work like typing, yet still continue to generate energy. You can call it 'power from doing nothing.'""

Previous sweat-based energy devices required intense exercise, such as a great deal of running or biking, before the user sweated enough to activate power generation. But the large amount of energy consumed during exercise can easily cancel out the energy produced, often resulting in energy return on investment of less than 1%.

In contrast, this device falls into what the authors call the ""holy grail"" category of energy harvesters. Instead of relying on external, irregular sources like sunlight or movement, all it needs is finger contact to collect more than 300 mJ of energy during sleep -- which the authors say is enough to power some small wearable electronics. Since no movement is needed, the ratio between harvested energy and invested energy is essentially infinite.

It may seem odd to choose fingertips as the source of this sweat over, say, the underarms, but in fact, fingertips have the highest concentration of sweat glands compared to anywhere else on the body.

""Generating more sweat at the fingers probably evolved to help us better grip things,"" says first co-author Lu Yin (@YinLu_CLT), a nanoengineering PhD student working in Wang's lab. ""Sweat rates on the finger can reach as high as a few microliters per square centimeter per minute. This is significant compared to other locations on the body, where sweat rates are maybe two or three orders of magnitude smaller.""

The device the researchers developed in this study is a type of energy harvester called a biofuel cell (BFC) and is powered by lactate, a dissolved compound in sweat. From the outside, it looks like a simple piece of foam connected to a circuit with electrodes, all of which is attached to the pad of a finger. The foam is made out of carbon nanotube material, and the device also contains a hydrogel that helps maximize sweat absorption.

""The size of the device is about 1 centimeter squared. Its material is flexible as well, so you don't need to worry about it being too rigid or feeling weird. You can comfortably wear it for an extended period of time,"" says Yin.

Within the device, a series of electrochemical reactions occur. The cells are equipped with a bioenzyme on the anode that oxidizes, or removes electrons from, the lactate; the cathode is deposited with a small amount of platinum to catalyze a reduction reaction that takes the electron to turn oxygen into water. Once this happens, electrons flow from the lactate through the circuit, creating a current of electricity. This process occurs spontaneously: as long as there is lactate, no additional energy is needed to kickstart the process.

Separate from but complementary to the BFC, piezoelectric generators -- which convert mechanical energy into electricity -- are also attached to the device to harvest up to 20% additional energy. Relying on the natural pinching motion of fingers or everyday motions like typing, these generators helped produce additional energy from barely any work: a single press of a finger once per hour required only 0.5 mJ of energy but produced over 30 mJ of energy, a 6,000% return in investment.

The researchers were able to use the device to power effective vitamin C- and sodium-sensing systems, and they are optimistic about improving the device to have even greater abilities in the future, which might make it suitable for health and wellness applications such as glucose meters for people with diabetes. ""We want to make this device more tightly integrated in wearable forms, like gloves. We're also exploring the possibility of enabling wireless connection to mobile devices for extended continuous sensing,"" Yin says.

""There's a lot of exciting potential,"" says Wang. ""We have ten fingers to play with."""
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"Electric signals between individual cardiac cells regulate heartbeat
Researchers provide an update on how electrical impulses in the heart travel from cell to cell. The connections between cells forming the low resistance pathway and facilitating the current flow are called gap junctions. Each consists of many channels, which are formed when specific proteins from one cell dock and fuse to the proteins from another cell. The scientists delve into the properties of gap junctions and their constituent proteins.
The rhythm in a working heart is regulated by electrical impulses. Disturbances of this bioelectrical process can result in cardiac arrhythmias, or irregularities in heartbeat -- a common ailment that can lead to illness and death.

In Biophysics Reviews, by AIP Publishing, researchers from Harvard Medical School provide a state-of-the-art update on how electrical impulses in the heart travel from cell to cell.

A functioning heart contracts to pump blood to the body and the lungs. Within the heart, a pacemaker acts as an electrical clock, sending out a signal that tells the heart when to contract. The whole muscle moves together, because each individual cell inside of it contracts in a coordinated manner and within a short time interval.

In order to do so, the initial electrical impulse, sent by the pacemaker, rapidly spreads through cells across the heart.

""If one cell is excited electrically and the other is not, the excited cell becomes positively charged inside, and the resting cell is still negatively charged inside. As a consequence, a voltage gradient builds up between the cells,"" said author André Kléber. ""If you have a voltage gradient and a pathway with a low electrical resistance, a local current will flow.""

The connections between cells forming the low resistance pathway and facilitating the current flow are called gap junctions. Each consists of many channels, which are formed when specific proteins from one cell dock and fuse to the proteins from another cell. Kléber said the fusing proteins look like placing the tips of your fingers on one hand to the fingers on the other hand.

The scientists delve into the properties of gap junctions and their constituent proteins, the so-called connexins. Kléber said one reason gap junction channels are interesting is because they are a highly dynamic system in equilibrium. The creation, or synthesis, of the channels equals the destruction.

""The turnover is very short,"" he said. ""On one hand, the system is very stable during your whole life. On the other hand, if you measure it, it is constantly cycling in periods of a few hours.""

The proteins found in gap junctions are important for processes not directly related to cell-cell connections, like mitochondrial function, which creates energy, and trafficking, which transports molecules from the site of synthesis to their site of action in the cell interior.

""You have to refrain from the idea that if you define the role of a protein in the body, that it has only a single function,"" said Kléber. ""Nature is much, much smarter than human beings.""

Scientists at Tokyo Institute of Technology have developed a computational method based on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to predict the cell-membrane permeability of cyclic peptides using a supercomputer. Their protocol has exhibited promising accuracy and may become a useful tool for the design and discovery of cyclic peptide drugs, which could help us reach new therapeutic targets inside cells beyond the capabilities of conventional small-molecule drugs or antibody-based drugs.

Cyclic peptide drugs have attracted the attention of major pharmaceutical companies around the world as promising alternatives to conventional small molecule-based drugs. Through proper design, cyclic peptides can be tailored to reach specific targets inside cells, such as protein-protein interactions, which are beyond the scope of small molecules. Unfortunately, it has proven notoriously difficult to design cyclic peptides with high cell-membrane permeability -- that is, cyclic peptides that can easily diffuse through the lipid bilayer that delimits the inside and outside of a cell.

In an effort to resolve this bottleneck, scientists at the Middle Molecule IT-based Drug Discovery Laboratory (MIDL) have been working on a computational method for predicting cell-membrane permeability. Established in September 2017, MIDL is one of the ""Research Initiatives"" at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) that goes beyond the boundaries of departments. Under the support of the Program for Building Regional Innovation Ecosystems of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), MIDL has been working with the city of Kawasaki to industrialize a framework for discovering middle molecule-based drugs -- cyclic peptide drugs and nucleic acid drugs larger than conventional small-molecule drugs but smaller than antibody-based drugs -- by combining computational drug design and chemical synthesis technology.

In a recent study published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, Professor Yutaka Akiyama and colleagues from MIDL and Tokyo Tech have developed a protocol for predicting the cell-membrane permeability of cyclic peptides using molecular dynamics simulations. Such simulations constitute a widely accepted computational approach for predicting and reproducing the dynamics of atoms and molecules by sequentially solving Newton's laws of motion at short time intervals. However, even a single simulation for predicting the permeability of a cyclic peptide with only eight amino acids takes a tremendous amount of time and resources. ""Our study marks the first time comprehensive simulations were performed for as many as 156 different cyclic peptides,"" highlights Prof. Akiyama, ""The simulation of each cyclic peptide using the protocol we developed took about 70 hours per peptide using 28 GPUs on the TSUBAME 3.0 supercomputer at Tokyo Tech.""

The researchers verified the predicted permeability values with experimentally derived ones and confirmed an acceptable correlation coefficient of R = 0.63 under the best conditions, showcasing the potential of their protocol. Moreover, after a detailed analysis of the peptide conformation and energy values obtained from the trajectory data, Prof. Akiyama's team found that the strength of the electrostatic interactions between the atoms constituting the cyclic peptide and the surrounding media, namely lipid membrane and water molecules, are strongly related to the membrane permeability value. The simulations also revealed the way in which peptides permeate through the membrane by changing their orientation and conformation according to their surroundings. ""Our results shed some light on the mechanisms of cell-membrane permeability and provide a guideline for designing molecules that can get inside cells more efficiently. This will greatly contribute to the development of next-generation peptide drugs,"" remarks Prof. Masatake Sugita, the first author of the study.

The researchers are already working on a more advanced simulation protocol that will enable more accurate predictions. They are also trying to incorporate artificial intelligence into the picture by adopting deep learning techniques, which could increase both accuracy and speed. Considering that cyclic peptides could unlock many therapeutic targets for diseases that are difficult to treat, let us hope that scientists at MIDL and Tokyo Tech succeed in their endeavors!"

FULL STORY
Crenarchaeol is a large, closed-loop lipid that is present in the membranes of ammonium-oxidizing archaea, a unicellular life form that exists ubiquitously in the oceans. In comparison to other archaeal membrane lipids, crenarchaeol is very complex and, so far, attempts to confirm its structure by synthesizing the entire molecule have been unsuccessful. Organic chemists from the University of Groningen have taken up this challenge and discovered that the proposed structure for the molecule was largely, but not entirely, correct.

Crenarchaeol contains 86 carbon atoms and is a 'macrocycle, a large closed loop. No fewer than 22 positions in the molecule are chiral. The molecule can be present in two forms that are each other's mirror image, like a left and a right hand. In the crenarchaeol molecule, all 22 chiral centres have their own specific 'handedness'. Furthermore, crenarchaeol contains a very uncommon cyclohexane group.

Challenge

This complex molecule was first isolated in 2002 by Jaap Sinninghe Damsté and colleagues at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, NIOZ. They identified its structure using spectroscopic techniques but their result has never been confirmed. This is surprising because ammonium-oxidizing archaea play a key role in the oceanic nitrogen cycle and fossil crenarchaeol and its companion lipids are widely used by molecular palaeontologists to reconstruct past sea temperatures. 'The structure of crenarchaeol is a formidable challenge for synthetic organic chemistry,' says Adri Minnaard, Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Groningen. 'And we decided to take it up.'

First, 3 milligrams of the natural compound were isolated and purified at NIOZ, which took about three months. There are only tiny amounts of crenarchaeol in each cell, just 0.000000001 gram, but because there are so many of these cells in the world's oceans and since the molecule is very stable and has accumulated in the sediment for millions of years, it is believed to be one of the most abundant organic molecules in marine sediments.

Mount Everest

There are several problems with synthesizing crenarchaeol; getting all the chiral centres in the correct orientation is one of them. 'And the molecule contains a lot of carbon-carbon bonds, which are difficult to construct.' But it is a challenge that a synthetic organic chemist cannot resist -- just like an ambitious mountaineer cannot resist Mount Everest. Minnaard showed the structure to his PhD student Mira Holzheimer, who worked on palladium-catalyzed synthetic reactions. 'Her literal response was: ""I want to climb that mountain."" ' They made a plan of attack on paper, which involved taking the molecule apart into the building blocks that could be synthesized. This produced a tentative route towards the synthesis of complete crenarchaeol molecules, which Holzheimer explored.

Similar to climbing a mountain for the first time, the synthetic route that they designed at the start sometimes led to a dead end. This meant retracing these steps and trying a new approach. 'You start with multiple grams of the basic compounds. But in each of the more than 65 intermediate steps, you lose material, sometimes up to 50 per cent. And if you run out of intermediates, you have to go all the way back again,' Minnaard explains.

Shock

After three years of hard work, Holzheimer had produced a large chunk of the molecule, roughly half of the macrocycle. Minnaard: 'At that stage, we decided to check it against the corresponding part of natural crenarchaeol.' This was done using coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The comparison was made at NIOZ and the results came as a shock: 'We synthesized the correct carbon skeleton, but the chromatographic behaviour was not the same as that for natural crenarchaeol. Something was wrong', Minnaard recalls.

After two days of checking, Minnaard and Holzheimer concluded that they really had made the proposed structure. And as it did not match completely with natural crenarchaeol, this could only mean one thing: the proposed structure was not entirely correct. The results pointed towards one of the chiral centres of the unusual cyclohexane group. 'Our collaborators at NIOZ mis-assigned just one chiral centre out of 22.' The structure correction was further supported by calculations on the spectra of both natural and prepared crenarchaeol, which were performed by Prof. Remco Havenith and Dr Ana Da Cunha. Minnaard: 'This shows the value of synthetic chemistry: building a proposed structure is the gold standard for validation.'

Art

Such a complex build as with crenarchaeol does bring some additional pay-offs: 'We had to develop new synthetic tools, that are now added to the organic synthesis toolbox.' Furthermore, having the correct structure is relevant for scientists who are studying archaeal membranes. This is usually done through molecular dynamics simulation, explains Minnaard, and the entirely correct structure is now available. Yet this pay-off is not the biggest motivation for Minnaard to take on these projects: 'It doesn't always have to have a purpose. To me, building molecules can be art.'

Excess urban heat is common within cities, but not all communities burden the consequences equally, according to new UC San Diego research
Low-income neighborhoods and communities with higher Black, Hispanic and Asian populations experience significantly more urban heat than wealthier and predominantly white neighborhoods within a vast majority of populous US counties, according new research.
Low-income neighborhoods and communities with higher Black, Hispanic and Asian populations experience significantly more urban heat than wealthier and predominantly white neighborhoods within a vast majority of populous U.S. counties, according new research from the University of California San Diego's School of Global Policy and Strategy.

The analysis of remotely-sensed land surface temperature measurements of 1,056 U.S. counties, which have ten or more census districts, was recently published in the journal Earth's Future. It reveals that for 71 percent of these counties, land surface temperatures in communities with higher rates of poverty can be up to 4 degrees Celsius, or 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer, compared to the richest neighborhoods during the summer months. The same is true for minority communities across the country compared to their non-Hispanic, White neighbors -- even when controlling for income.

""The physical features driving surface heat spikes in these urban environments are fairly consistent across the country, even for cities with very different geographies and histories,"" said first author Susanne Benz, who was a postdoctoral fellow supported by the School of Global Policy and Strategy's Big Pixel Initiative while conducting the study. ""Systematically, the disproportionate heat surface exposures faced by low-income communities with larger minority populations are due to more built-up neighborhoods, less vegetation, and -- to a lesser extent -- higher population density.""

Benz co-authored the paper with her postdoctoral supervisor Jennifer Burney, the Marshall Saunders Chancellor's Endowed Chair in Global Climate Policy and Research at the School of Global Policy and Strategy.

""Particularly in summer, warming in cities due to alterations of the surface energy balance jeopardizes human health and productivity,"" said Burney. ""The distribution of excess urban heat varies within cities, and as a result, communities do not share a city's extreme heat burden equally.""

Extreme heat has been linked to a range of consequences for humans, from premature births, to lower test scores, decreases in productivity and increased risk of heatstroke among children and the elderly.

Benz and Burney were able to analyze surface temperature changes caused by urbanization on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood scale by using satellite-data. Through leveraging a pixel-based image analysis to visualize and examine temperatures continuously over a large area, they could evaluate heating differences within cities. They compared these statistics to census district demographic information to quantify environmental inequities in urban climates.

The researchers made the data publicly available through the creation of an app, powered by Google Earth Engine, which community members can use to see how the temperatures in their neighborhood compare to surrounding areas.

40 percent of the world's populace experiences urban heat

In a separate, but related study recently published in Environmental Research Letters, Benz, Burney and co-author Steven Davis of UC Irvine, utilized the same methodology to provide a global analysis of heat anomalies that occur in all cities by comparing temperatures in urban areas to nearby and otherwise similar rural areas.

The team also made this data publicly available through a Google Earth Engine app, which provides users in urban neighborhoods a visual analysis of the temperature anomalies in their area and surrounding regions.

The data are provided for 200 M satellite-observed pixels and include urban heating measurements for the more than 13,000 of the world's major city clusters.

The study reveals 75 percent of urban populations in these cities (about 1.8 billion people) experience urban heat during the daytime and nighttime in summer. On average, a person living in an urban environment is exposed to temperatures that are 3 degrees Celsius or 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than temperatures in their rural surroundings during summer days.

The results have major implications, as more than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas. With warming increasing and trends of rural-to-urban migration expected to continue through the end of the century, the number of people living in extreme urban heat is expected to grow by 20 percent, affecting more than 2 billion people by the end of the century.

Urban green spaces are scarce, yet are needed to offset rising temperatures in cities

The Environmental Research Letters paper also explores potential for policies to mitigate the damages of heat anomalies experienced in urban areas.

The team looked for global patterns that explained why certain cities had a lower urban heat burden than others, or even maintained cooler temperatures than their rural surroundings. They found vegetation and the number of built-up areas to be the two biggest drivers that create or offset heat within urban areas. Examples include desert cities like Palm Springs, which experience urban cooling due to more vegetation and light-colored street surfaces, roofs and other building materials.

Currently, 82 percent of all urban areas have less and/or light-colored surfaces than comparable cities.

""With more trees and greenery planted and changing building materials to pale colors that attract less sun, damages caused by urban heating in these areas could be offset,"" the authors note.

The research team found that more vegetation planted could reduce summer temperatures on average by 0.6 degree Celsius or 1 degree Fahrenheit for 59 percent of the urban population. If building and roof colors were adjusted, in addition to more vegetation added, temperatures can drop by as much as 2.6 degrees Celsius and 4.6 degrees Fahrenheit, reducing heat for 83 percent of urban residents, which equates to 27 percent of the world's population.

The authors conclude that as urbanization continues to increase, city planners need to take equitable access to ecosystem services provided, such as urban green spaces.

Benz and Burney suggest that the main takeaway of these two studies is that a different approach is required to city planning and policymaking.

""Smart urban planning cannot continue to be treated as a luxury item or else the most vulnerable populations will be further left behind and heat-based suffering will worsen for billions around the world,"" Benz and Burney write. ""Access to livable urban temperatures for all neighborhoods must become something we consider as essential for the vibrancy and functionality in our cities.""

University of Kentucky
A recently published study identifies 11 rare candidate variants for Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found 19 different families in Utah that suffered from Alzheimer's disease more frequently than what is considered normal.
A recently published study co-authored by University of Kentucky Sanders-Brown Center on Aging researcher Justin Miller, Ph.D., identifies 11 rare candidate variants for Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found 19 different families in Utah that suffered from Alzheimer's disease more frequently than what is considered normal.

Miller, an assistant professor in the UK College of Medicine, was a co-first author for the study published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia. The work was started at another university, however, some of the computational work was done after Miller arrived at UK in March.

For the study, genetic sequencing was conducted on two cousins from each of the 19 families. Miller says they then identified genetic variants that were shared between both cousins.

""We then used a series of filtering criteria to identify rare genetic variants that were most likely contributing to the excess Alzheimer's disease in each family,"" he said.

Researchers found 11 rare genetic variants spanning 10 genes, including previously unknown variants in two known Alzheimer's disease risk genes.

""Identifying people with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease before they become symptomatic may lead to earlier and more effective interventions,"" Miller said. ""Additionally, our methodology for analyzing high-risk pedigrees can be used to prioritize rare genetic variants that likely contribute to disease.""

Miller says while this discovery will not immediately impact patient care, they do believe identifying genetic variants associated with the disease is the first step to identifying potential drug targets that can be used to develop therapeutics.

This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Huntsman Cancer Institute, Brigham Young University, University of Utah, National Cancer Institute, BrightFocus Foundation, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and was a collaboration with Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, and the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium."

Organoids help understand the complex interactions of cells and tissue
Technical University of Munich (TUM)
In addition to chemical factors, mechanical influences play an important role in the natural growth of human organs such as kidneys, lungs and mammary glands - but also in the development of tumors. Now a research team has investigated the process in detail using organoids, three-dimensional model systems of such organs which are produced in the laboratory.
In addition to chemical factors, mechanical influences play an important role in the natural growth of human organs such as kidneys, lungs and mammary glands -- but also in the development of tumors. Now a research team at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has investigated the process in detail using organoids, three-dimensional model systems of such organs which are produced in the laboratory.

Organoids are three-dimensional systems modeling various human organs. Grown in the laboratory, they exhibit properties similar to those of actual body tissue. Organoids offer science new opportunities to simulate and investigate the processes of organ growth. These processes could not be observed in the simplified two-dimensional model systems used in the past.

Using mammary gland organoids to analyze the complex interactions of cells with surrounding tissue, scientists at the Technical University of Munich, the Helmholtz Zentrum München and the Ruhr-Universität Bochum have shown, that the growth of the gland tissue in the human breast is explicitly influenced by the mechanical properties of the surrounding collagen network.

Integrated dynamic development process

The organoids grown by the team form branched glandular ducts whose structure and organization very closely resemble that of the human mammary gland. During the growth process the individual organoid branches invade into the surrounding collagen matrix.

""Starting with a single stem cell, in just 14 days these organoids form a complex, branched, three-dimensional structure consisting of several thousand cells. This is absolutely fascinating,"" says Andreas Bausch, Professor for Cellular Biophysics at TU Munich and head of the research group.

The research team used temporally resolved microscopy on the growing structures over the course of several days and successfully monitored the dynamic development process in detail. They discovered that the organoid growth is substantially dictated by collective movements of the cells.

By expanding in the direction of movement and then contracting again, the cells generate forces so strong that they deform the surrounding collagen matrix, making it possible for the organoid to independently organize the direction of its own further growth.

Stable collagen 'cage'

""This is made possible by the mechanical plasticity of the collagen,"" says Benedikt Buchmann, lead author of the research team's study. ""When the individual cells move back and forth collectively they produce such tension that the cells of a branch can deform the collagen matrix.""

The overall process results in the formation of a mechanically stable collagen 'cage' which ultimately surrounds the growing branch. This collagen cage then controls the further generation of tension, the growth of the branches and the plastic deformation of the matrix.

These findings provide the basis for the use of this model system to investigate more complex processes such as the first steps in metastasis or mutual interaction with other cell types. Intensive current research is now on the way to determine whether this self-organization mechanism also occurs in other organs."
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"Electrons in quantum liquid gain energy from laser pulses The absorption of energy from laser light by free electrons in a liquid has been demonstrated for the first time. Until now, this process was observed only in the gas phase. The findings open new doors for ultra-fast electron microscopy.
The absorption of energy from laser light by free electrons in a liquid has been demonstrated for the first time. Until now, this process was observed only in the gas phase. The findings, led by Graz University of Technology, open new doors for ultra-fast electron microscopy.

The investigation and development of materials crucially depends on the ability to observe smallest objects at fastest time scales. The necessary spatial resolution for investigations in the (sub-)atomic range can be achieved with electron microscopy. For the most rapid processes, however, proceeding within a few femtoseconds (quadrillionths of a second), the time resolution of conventional electron microscopes is insufficient. To improve the time duration of electron pulses, electrons would have to be selected within a shorter time window -- in analogy to a camera shutter, which controls the exposure time in photography.

In principle, this temporal selection is possible with extremely short laser pulses through a process called laser-assisted electron scattering (LAES). In this process, electrons can absorb energy from the light field during collisions with atoms of the sample under investigation. ""Structural information is provided by all electrons, but those that have a higher energy level can be assigned to the time window in which the light pulse was present. With this method, it is possible to select a short time window from the long electron pulse and thus improve the time resolution,"" explains Markus Koch, professor at the Institute of Experimental Physics at Graz University of Technology. So far, however, LAES processes have only been observed in the gas phase, despite their investigation for about 50 years.

Markus Koch and his team, in collaboration with researchers from Photonics Institute at Vienna University of Technology and the Institute of Chemistry at Tokyo Metropolitan University, have now demonstrated for the first time that laser-assisted electron scattering can also be observed in condensed matter, specifically in superfluid helium.

Superfluid helium leading to success

The TU Graz researchers performed the experiment in a superfluid helium droplet of few nanometer diameter (3-30 nm), into which they loaded single atoms (indium or xenon) or molecules (acetone) that served as an electron source -- a field of expertise at the institute. ""The free electrons can move almost without friction within the droplet and absorb more energy in the light field than they lose in collisions with the helium atoms,"" says Leonhard Treiber, the PhD student in charge of the experiment. The resulting acceleration allows for the observation of much faster electrons.

The experiments could be interpreted in cooperation with Markus Kitzler-Zeiler, an expert for strong-field processes at TU Wien, and the LAES process was confirmed through simulations by Reika Kanya from Tokyo Metropolitan University. The results were published in Nature Communications.

In the future, the LAES process will be studied within thin films of various materials, also produced inside helium droplets, in order to determine important parameters such as the optimal film thickness or the favourable intensity of the laser pulses for application in an electron microscope."

The study explored the success of country-level protected areas at reducing forest loss, and used machine learning to uncover some of the factors that contribute to differences in effectiveness.
Scientists have published a global study on the effectiveness of protected areas in preventing deforestation.

The study, published recently in Environmental Research Letters, explored the success of country-level protected areas at reducing forest loss, and used machine learning to uncover some of the factors that contribute to differences in effectiveness.

""Protected areas are a key conservation tool that are essential for stemming the tide of biodiversity and habitat loss across the Earth,"" said first author, Dr. Payal Shah, a research scientist at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), who specializes in applying economic theory to conservation.

She added: ""Scientists are calling for 30% of land and ocean to be protected by 2030. But as more and more land is placed under protection, it's increasingly important to measure how well each protected area is working, so policy makers can make more informed decisions about future conservation efforts.""

For the study, the research team used satellite data of forest cover between the years 2000-2012, focusing on protected areas that had been established during this timeframe. Countries that had not placed a large enough area of land into protection were removed from the analysis.

For the 81 countries that remained in the analysis, 3.2 million square kilometers of land had been placed into protection. The research team then estimated how effective these protected areas were by comparing changes in forest cover between protected and statistically matched unprotected areas. The areas of land were matched using a wide range of factors that are important predictors of deforestation, including their distance to cities, their elevation from sea level and the slope of the land.

""The aim was to try and understand how much deforestation would have occurred in an alternative scenario -- if an area had not been placed under protection,"" explained Dr. Shah.

The researchers found that overall, around 34,000 square kilometers of forest was lost within newly established protected areas between 2000 and 2012 -- an area larger than the size of Belgium. However, they estimated that if these protected areas had not been put into place, an additional 86,062 square kilometers of forest would have also been lost. This would have meant that an area of land totaling around 120,000 square kilometers -- the size of North Korea -- would have been deforested.

""This means that protected areas on the whole reduced deforestation by 72%, which is great news,"" said Dr. Shah. ""But when you start breaking down the data by country, the results are more mixed.""

The scientists saw that protected areas in some countries performed significantly better than other countries within their region. Leading the way were South Africa, Cambodia, Latvia, Guatemala, Uruguay, Brazil and New Zealand, for the regions of Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South American and Oceania, respectively.

The research team estimated that if all the other countries' protected areas had been as successful as the best performing country in their region, then an additional 33,020 square kilometers of forests would have been saved, which would have reduced deforestation within the newly established protected areas to roughly 1000 square kilometers only.

""The countries in each region are battling against similar key drivers of deforestation, such as timber logging or wildfires, so theoretically, every country has the potential to do equally well,"" said Dr. Shah. ""But we are seeing these huge disparities in the effectiveness of their protected areas. So of course, we then want to understand the underlying factors.""

One main factor found was based on the strictness of the protected areas. Strictness categories are based on the degree of human activity or use of natural resources allowed on the land. In most countries, more strictly protected areas were more effective than less strictly protected areas.

Next, the researchers fed data on the demographics, agriculture, economy and politics of each country into a machine learning algorithm, which then identified which factors were most strongly linked to the effectiveness of the country's protected area network.

Countries with high levels of economic growth were associated with higher levels of effectiveness for protected areas.

Meanwhile, countries with higher levels of agricultural activity tended to have less effective protected areas, particularly in countries that had a lower quality of governance and growing rural populations.

""This was expected as agriculture and deforestation often go hand in hand,"" explained Dr. Shah. ""Land is a limited resource so in countries with high agricultural activity, there may be a large deforestation pressures within protected areas in countries that lack proper governance.""

However, the researchers emphasized that more in-depth research needs to be done on a country-by-country basis to confirm the reasons underlying these associations.

""As a global analysis, this study allows us to pinpoint which countries are doing well, and which are doing less well,"" said Dr. Shah. ""We can then carry out more targeted research in these countries to help support more effective conservation strategies."""
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"Simulating microswimmers in nematic fluids
New research shows how control over self-propelled microswimmers could be achieved using exotic materials named 'nematic liquid crystals' - whose viscosity and elasticity can vary depending on the direction of an applied force.
Artificial microswimmers have received much attention in recent years. By mimicking microbes which convert their surrounding energy into swimming motions, these particles could soon be exploited for many important applications. Yet before this can happen, researchers must develop methods to better control the trajectories of individual microswimmers in complex environments. In a new study published inEPJ E, Shubhadeep Mandal at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (India), and Marco Mazza at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organisation in Göttingen (Germany) and Loughborough University (UK), show how this control could be achieved using exotic materials named 'nematic liquid crystals' (LCs) -- whose viscosity and elasticity can vary depending on the direction of an applied force.

The duo's discoveries could inform the future use of cargo-carrying microswimmers in delicate medical procedures: including drug delivery, disease monitoring, and non-invasive surgery. Through the use of biocompatible nematic LCs, these techniques could be easily and safely integrated with the bodies of patients. Typically, microswimmers propel themselves forward by either pushing or pulling the fluid surrounding them. So far, these motions haven't been widely studied in less conventional fluids like nematic LCs -- which have orderly crystal structures, but can also flow like liquids.

Mandal and Mazza studied this scenario using 'multiparticle collision dynamics' algorithms, which describe how the atomic structures of nematic LCs vary over time. Combined with simulations of spherical microswimmers, the algorithms allowed them to investigate how the direction-dependent viscosities and elasticities of nematic LCs can affect the speeds and orientations of spherical microswimmers. Previous studies showed that their motions are starkly different to those found in conventional fluids; with microswimmers following non-random trajectories to minimise their elastic energy. Mandal and Mazza now also show that a microswimmer's speed will vary depending on whether it pushes or pulls the surrounding fluid; and also becomes slower when it pushes with a stronger force. The duo now hope that their simulation techniques could be easily extended to model the dynamics of multiple microswimmers."

A lone sheep leg, likely discarded by hungry mine workers, lay hidden in a salt mine in Iran for over a thousand years, during which time the salinity of the surrounding environment naturally mummified the limb. Now, scientists have extracted pristine DNA from the mummified leg and dated the sample to the fifth or sixth century.

The DNA molecules were ""so well preserved and not fragmented, despite their age,"" senior study author Kevin Daly, a research fellow at the Smurfit Institute of Genetics at Trinity College Dublin, told Live Science. This immaculate preservation not only allowed the team to examine DNA from the sheep, but also the genetic material of salt-loving microbes that grew on the specimen, the team reported in a new study, published July 13 in the journal Biology Letters.

Archaeologists first recovered the sheep leg from an ancient salt mine located near the village of Chehrabad in northwest Iran; the same mine has also shielded a number of human bodies from decay over the millenia.

In the 1930s, a Swiss astronomer named Fritz Zwicky noticed that galaxies in a distant cluster were orbiting one another much faster than they should have been given the amount of visible mass they had. He proposed than an unseen substance, which he called dark matter, might be tugging gravitationally on these galaxies.

Since then, researchers have confirmed that this mysterious material can be found throughout the cosmos, and that it is six times more abundant than the normal matter that makes up ordinary things like stars and people. Yet despite seeing dark matter throughout the universe, scientists are mostly still scratching their heads over it. Here are the 11 biggest unanswered questions about dark matter.

What is dark matter?

dark matter mysteries
(Image credit: Shutterstock)
First and perhaps most perplexingly, researchers remain unsure about what exactly dark matter is. Originally, some scientists conjectured that the missing mass in the universe was made up of small faint stars and black holes, though detailed observations have not turned up nearly enough such objects to account for dark matter's influence, as physicist Don Lincoln of the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermilab previously wrote for Live Science. The current leading contender for dark matter's mantle is a hypothetical particle called a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle, or WIMP, which would behave sort of like a neutron except would be between 10 and 100 times heavier than a proton, as Lincoln wrote. Yet, this conjecture has only led to more questions ­ — for instance…

Can we detect dark matter?

If dark matter is made from WIMPs, they should be all around us, invisible and barely detectable. So why haven't we found any yet? While they wouldn't interact with ordinary matter very much, there is always some slight chance that a dark-matter particle could hit a normal particle like a proton or electron as it travels through space. So, researchers have built experiment after experiment to study huge numbers of ordinary particles deep underground, where they are shielded from interfering radiation that could mimic a dark-matter-particle collision. The problem? After decades of searching, not one of these detectors has made a credible discovery. Earlier this year, the Chinese PandaX experiment reported the latest WIMP nondetection. It seems likely that dark-matter particles are much smaller than WIMPs, or lack the properties that would make them easy to study, physicist Hai-Bo Yu of the University of California, Riverside, told Live Science at the time.

Does dark matter consist of more than one particle?

dark matter mysteries
(Image credit: Maria Starovoytova/Shutterstock)
Ordinary matter is made up of everyday particles like protons and electrons, as well as a whole zoo of more exotic particles like neutrinos, muons and pions. So, some researchers have wondered if dark matter, which makes up 85 percent of the matter in the universe, might also be just as complicated. ""There is no good reason to assume that all the dark matter in the universe is built out of one type of particle,"" physicist Andrey Katz of Harvard University said to Space.com, Live Science's sister site. Dark protons could combine with dark electrons to form dark atoms, producing configurations as diverse and interesting as those found in the visible world, Katz said. While such proposals have increasingly been imagined in physics labs, figuring out a way to confirm or deny them has so far eluded scientists. [Strange Quarks and Muons, Oh My! Nature's Tiniest Particles Dissected]

Do dark forces exist?

Along with additional particles of dark matter, there is the possibility that dark matter experiences forces analogous to those felt by regular matter. Some researchers have searched for ""dark photons,"" which would be like the photons exchanged between normal particles that give rise to the electromagnetic force, except they would be felt only by dark matter particles. Physicists in Italy are gearing up to smash a beam of electrons and their antiparticles, known as positrons, into a diamond, as Live Science previously reported. If dark photons do exist, the electron-positron pairs could annihilate and produce one of the strange force-carrying particles, potentially opening a brand-new sector of the universe."
,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"Could dark matter be made of axions?

(Image credit: Marcel Clemens/Shutterstock)
As physicists increasingly fall out of love with WIMPs, other dark-matter particles are starting to gain favor. One of the leading replacements is a hypothetical particle known as an axion, which would be extremely light, perhaps as little as 10 raised to the 31st power less massive than a proton. Axions are now being searched for in a few experiments. Recent computer simulations have raised the possibility that these axions could form star-like objects, which might produce detectable radiation that would be quite similar to mysterious phenomena known as fast-radio bursts, as Live Science previously reported.

What are the properties of dark matter?

Astronomers discovered dark matter through its gravitational interactions with ordinary matter, suggesting that this is its main way of making its presence known in the universe. But when trying to understand the true nature of dark matter, researchers have remarkably little to go on. According to some theories, dark-matter particles should be their own antiparticles, meaning that two dark-matter particles would annihilate with one another when they meet. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment on the International Space Station has been searching for the telltale signs of this annihilation since 2011and has already detected hundreds of thousands of events. Scientists still aren't sure if these are coming from dark matter, and the signal has yet to help them pin down exactly what dark matter is.


Does dark matter exist in every galaxy?

Because it so massively outweighs ordinary matter, dark matter is often said to be the controlling force that organizes large structures such as galaxies and galactic clusters. So, it was strange when, earlier this year, astronomers announced that they had found a galaxy named NGC 1052-DF2 that seemed to contain hardly any dark matter at all. ""Dark matter is apparently not a requirement for forming a galaxy,"" Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University told Space.com at the time. However, over the summer, a separate team posted an analysis suggesting that van Dokkum's team had mismeasured the distance to the galaxy, meaning its visible matter was much dimmer and lighter than the first findings and that more of its mass was in dark matter than was previously suggested.

What's up with the DAMA/LIBRA results?

A long-standing mystery in particle physics are the puzzling results of a European experiment known as DAMA/LIBRA. This detector — located in an underground mine below the Gran Sasso mountain in Italy — has been searching for a periodic oscillation in dark matter particles. This oscillation should arise as the Earth moves in its orbit around the sun while flying through the galactic stream of dark matter surrounding our solar system, sometimes called the dark matter wind. Since 1997, DAMA/LIBRA has claimed to see exactly this signal, though no other experiment has seen anything like this.  

Could dark matter have an electrical charge?

A signal from the beginning of time has led some physicists to suggest that dark matter might have an electrical charge. Radiation with a wavelength of 21 centimeters was emitted by stars in the universe's infancy, just 180 million years after the Big Bang. It was then absorbed by cold hydrogen that was around at the same time. When this radiation was detected in February of this year, its signature suggested that the hydrogen was much colder than scientists had predicted. Astrophysicist Julian Muñoz of Harvard University hypothesized that dark matter with an electrical charge could have drawn heat away from the all-pervasive hydrogen, sort of like ice cubes floating in lemonade, as he told Live Science at the time. But the conjecture has yet to be confirmed.

Can ordinary particles decay into dark matter?

Neutrons are regular matter particles with a limited lifetime. After around 14.5 minutes, a lone neutron unmoored from an atom will decay into a proton, an electron and a neutrino. But two different experimental setups give slightly different lifetimes for this decay, with the discrepancy between them about 9 seconds, according to experiments cited in a July study in the journal Physical Review Letters. Earlier this year, physicists suggested that if 1 percent of the time, some neutrons were decaying into dark-matter particles, it could account for this anomaly. Christopher Morris from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico, and his team monitored neutrons for a signal that could be dark matter but were unable to detect anything. They suggested that other decay scenarios might still be possible, according to the study.

Does dark matter actually exist?

Given the difficulties that scientists have faced trying to detect and explain dark matter, a reasonable questioner might wonder if they're going about it all wrong. For many years, a vocal minority of physicists have pushed the idea that perhaps our theories of gravity are simply incorrect, and that the fundamental force works differently on large scales than we expect. Often known as ""modified Newtonian dynamics,"" or MOND models, these suggestions posit that there is no dark matter and the ultrafast speeds at which stars and galaxies are seen to rotate around one another is a consequence of gravity behaving in surprising ways. ""Dark matter is still an unconfirmed model,"" wrote physicist Don Lincoln in an explainer for Live Science. Yet the detractors have yet to convince the larger field of their ideas. And the latest evidence? It also suggests that dark matter is real.

,,,,,scientific development,,,,,,,,,"Rare 'teardrop' star and its invisible partner are doomed to explode in a massive supernova
By Brandon Specktor - Senior Writer about 12 hours ago

The star system is the closest Type Ia supernova candidate ever found near Earth.
The distinct teardrop shape of this bright star suggests that it is being tugged by a powerful, invisible companion.

Astronomers have discovered a rare, teardrop-shaped star swirling through the cosmos some 1,500 light-years from the sun.

Why does the star cry? Because it is in a toxic relationship with a partner that is literally ripping the life from its body. In stellar relationships like these, there is no amicable uncoupling; the romance only ends when both stars explode in a violent, thermonuclear explosion that's visible across the galaxy. You'd cry, too.

But astronomers (cosmic paparazzi that they are) are fired up about this twisted stellar relationship. The star system, named HD265435, is one of only three known binary star systems in the universe — and the closest one to Earth — that is clearly destined to end in a Type Ia supernova, according to a study published July 12 in the journal Nature Astronomy.

These types of stellar explosions occur when a white dwarf (the shriveled husk of an old, collapsed star) shares an orbit with a larger, younger star that still has some fuel left to burn. Small but gravitationally massive, the white dwarf gladly gobbles up this fuel, yanking so much matter away from its companion that the younger star begins to change shape from a sphere into an ellipse, or teardrop. The older star grows larger and larger over millions of years, finally becoming too big for its own good. Nuclear reactions reignite in its core, the dwarf goes boom and both stars become an irradiated smudge of gas and dust in the night sky.

Supernovas are easy enough to spot once the blast goes off (one infamous explosion lingered in Earth's sky for 23 days and nights in A.D. 1054), but finding the doomed star systems that lead to Type Ia explosions is much trickier. That's partly because white dwarfs are extremely dim and small, packing the mass of a sun into a ball about as wide as Earth, according to NASA.

Finding a dwarf's ill-fated companion star isn't much easier, but because these younger stars tend to be much brighter, they offer a few telltale clues, the authors of the new study wrote. One is an ""ellipsoid"" shape, suggesting that something massive is tugging on one side of the star and deforming it. Another clue is a rapidly pulsing light signature, which hints at a binary system where two stars are orbiting each other extremely closely and quickly.

Using observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, the researchers discovered that HD265435 fit both criteria. From these details, the team calculated the bright star's distance and mass, which allowed the researchers to make some informed estimates about the size and age of the young star’s invisible companion star."

Introduction
Macrolevel orientations in the sociology of science and in the sociology of international development and social change have alluded to the connection between science and development because national economic growth and scientific capacity (i.e., knowledge production, technological development, technical innovation, and scientific discovery) are empirically associated with each other (Castells, 2000; Grammig, 2002; Malmgren et al., 2010; Schofer, 2004; Schofer et al., 2000). For example, scientific knowledge production and technological development are almost always monopolized by economically powerful countries, such as the Group of Seven and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries (Bradshaw et al., 1993; Castells, 2000; Gereffi and Fonda, 1992; Migdal, 1988; Sernau, 2012). Countries in Africa (with the exception of South Africa), Asia (with the exception of Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan and more recently China and India), and Latin America (with the exception of Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico) have almost always been consumers of but never producers of knowledge, innovation, and technology; beneficiaries of technology transfer programs and initiatives but rarely benefactors. However, when knowledge, innovations, and technologies travel, or are exported to travel from their production sites in developed countries to test sites in developing countries, more often than not these packages of Western knowledge have proved largely ineffective, insensitive to, and incompatible with local needs, and have all too often resulted in a dependent and the uneven development of countries at the periphery of the global economic system (Bradshaw, 1988; Grammig, 2002).
Macrolevel data from the United Nations Development Programme indicate that countries at the high human development level have, on average, about 2335 scientists, technicians, and engineers per million people. Countries at the medium human development level have, on average, about 588 scientists, technicians, and engineers per million, while estimates are not available for countries at the low human development level (UNDP, 2003). Implicitly, these numbers indicate that science and technology are indispensable tools for national competitiveness and hegemony. Indeed, the geography of scientific and technological capacity has a major impact on the centers and networks of global society (Castells, 2000). With the goal of coming up with a contemporary view of science and development that takes into account the changes and shifts brought about by new information and communication technologies (ICTs), this article attempts to explain why developing countries (i.e., low-income countries or peripheral countries) are so enmeshed in pursuing a ‘Western way of knowing’ called science. Toward this goal, several theoretical perspectives are presented: modernization, dependency/world systems, institutional, global systems, postcolonial, and reagency. The intent is to show how each perspective views the nature of science. Toward the end, the authors propose a perspective that takes into account the changes and recalibrations in the logic (i.e., spatial and temporal) of social interaction resulting from the ‘time–space compression’ brought about by advances in ICT (Castells, 2000, 2001)."

W. Shrum, in International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, 2001
2 Development
The concept of development involves several dimensions of transformation, including the creation of wealth (that is, rapid and sustained economic growth) and its distribution in a fashion that benefits a broad spectrum of people rather than a small elite (that is, a reduction in social inequality). Cultural transformation (recognition of and attendant value placed on local traditions and heritage) has also been viewed as an important aspect of the process since the early 1980s. There is general agreement that development in the second half of the twentieth century is not a mere recapitulation of the process of industrialization that characterized Europe and North America in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Three theoretical perspectives, with many variations, have dominated development studies: modernization, dependency, and institutional. One way of distinguishing these theories is by their position on the ways in which relationships external to a country affect the process of change. Since scientific institutions and knowledge claims are of external origin, each of these perspectives views science and technology as important in the development process, with very different assessments of the costs and benefits.
2.1 Modernization
The oldest approach, sometimes called modernization theory, focused on the shift from a traditional, rural, agricultural society to a modern, urban, industrial form. Transformations internal to a country (such as formal education, a market economy, and democratic political structures) are emphasized, while external relationships are de-emphasized. However, science was the exception to this, available to benefit developing nations through technology transfer from Western sources. This idea relied on two assumptions. One was the ‘hardness’ of technological artifacts—their alleged independence from people and culture, their seeming ability to produce certain effects ‘no matter what.’ The second was the ‘linear model’ of technology development in which the (a) discoveries of basic science lead to the (b) practical knowledge of applied science and finally to (c) technological applications such as new products. In retrospect, both of these assumptions were simplistic in any context, but in the developing world they were especially problematic.
The assumption of ‘hardness’ has been replaced by the generalization that the uses, effects, and even the meanings of technological artifacts are affected by the context of use. First, effective technologies, from automobiles to indoor plumbing, do not typically stand alone, but are embedded in systems that provide infrastructure (roads, sewage treatment) which is often lacking. Second, the provision of artifacts such as buildings and computers is much easier than their maintenance, which requires both resources and knowledge. Third, introduction of new technology involves a multiplicity of consequences—positive and negative, short term and long term, economic and ecological. Many of these consequences are unpredictable, even in those rare cases where such foresight is attempted.
The case of the Green Revolution is illustrative. In the 1960s, widespread food shortages, population growth, and predicted famine in India prompted major international foundations to invest research and technology transfer efforts towards the goals of increasing agricultural productivity and the modernization of technology. What resulted were new kinds of maize, wheat, and rice. These modern varieties promised higher yields and rapid maturity, but not without other inputs and conditions. They were, rather, part of a ‘package’ that required fertilizers as well as crop protection inputs such as pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides—sometimes even irrigation and mechanization. Moreover, seed for these varieties had to be purchased anew each year.
The consequences of the Green Revolution are still debated, and there is little doubt that many of them were positive. Famine in India was averted through increased yields, but the benefits of the technology required capital investments that were only possible for wealthier farmers. Not only did the adoption of new technology increase dependence on the suppliers of inputs, but it was claimed to increase inequality by hurting the small farmer—one intended beneficiary of the technology. The actual complexity of the outcomes is revealed by one of the most sophisticated assessments—modern seed varieties do reach small farmers, increase employment, and decrease food prices, but the benefits are less than expected because the poor are increasingly landless workers or near landless farm laborers (Lipton and Longhurst 1989).
What is important for the question of the relationship between science and development is that the products and practices of the Green Revolution were research-based technology. This technology was often developed in international research institutes funded by multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and bilateral donors such as the US Agency for International Development. Since the combined resources of these donors dwarf those of many poor countries, their developmental and research priorities constitute a broad global influence on the nature of science for development. The largest and most visible of these organizations form a global research network, the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) which grew from 4 to 13 centers during the 1970s as support by donors quadrupled. The influence of this network of donors and international agencies was clearly evident in the early 1990s when environmental concerns led to an emphasis on ‘sustainability’ issues. This led to a change in CGIAR priorities, as the older emphasis on agricultural productivity shifted to the relatively more complex issue of natural resource management."

Whether we decide to use it, or not is entirely up to us, but blaming technology and science for our societal problems is not the answer. I believe that parents should put in an extra effort to learn about the new technological advancements of the day because not only does that allow them to be better informed, but it is a great tool for parenting. So much negativity about computers and its effects on people, particularly children, causes adults to stay out of the ""loop"". Bishop also mentions in his article that people fear things they do not know. When the majority of people do not understand more than half the things they need to know about computers, it is difficult for them, that is when they start fearing these things that are ultimately foreign to them. 



Science and technology offer a great deal to us, and it would be difficult to imagine any life, which would not be connected to science and technology in any way. Even the cars we drive are direct outcomes of science and technology. We depend on many things to go about our daily lives, and if it weren't for science and technology, we would be lost.

Newspaper gives us news, views, reviews and previews. Sometimes the word NEWS is interpreted as North, East, West and South. It means that the newspapers provide us with information and news regarding different subjects from all the directions.

Newspapers also give us articles on all kinds of topics such as political, social, economic, business commerce, sports, education, health etc. The Newspapers have different columns devoted to different topics. In them, we have matrimonial, editorial, readers, employment, women’s children’s and other columns.

Burning problems of the world are discussed in the newspapers. Elaborate articles by experts and specialists appear in them. Them the reader’s views and opinion and published in the reader’s column.

Newspapers are very powerful vehicles. They carry a lot of advertisements which attract the attention of customers. Advertisements are essential to run a paper. Newspapers can make or change a government as they act as powerful public opinion changes. They also contain book reviews of literary, historical and other books by eminent scholars.

We must not be misled by the views expressed in newspapers. We must weigh them on the scale of reason, as some newspapers may be prejudiced. But normally newspapers are important means for spreading literacy.

They are easily available in almost every region of the world and make people aware of certain important things around them. It is an economical means to get knowledge at a very low cost. Newspapers are available in different languages and thus it makes it easy for the people to read and get information in their own language.

Diverse topics are discussed and printed on newspapers such as related to business, sports, political, health, fitness and much more. Every column of the newspaper is reserved for a particular domain and topic. We can find jobs on newspaper in the employment column. Then there is a matrimonial column that helps people find their perfect match for marriages. Other than this, there are editorial, readers and many other columns that provide vast variety of information to the readers.

Newspapers are also a great means for advertising various kinds of products and services. Many big companies and firms advertise through newspapers as it help them gain popularity and huge client base. The newspaper firms earn a lot through these advertisements.

Well, there are various positive aspects of a newspaper, however there’s a negative side as well. Sometimes the newspaper companies publish fake news for the sake of some bucks and to provoke people for certain social issues which sometimes lead to fights and bloodshed.

In this highest technological era newspaper did not lose its identity. The Newspaper comes under print media.

The first known newspaper was introduced in 59 B.C. in Rome by Julius Caesar to make people aware of social and political events. Its name was ‘Acta Diurna’. Formerly it was used to carved on metal or stones and it was limited to some special cities. Now it is digitally available on your mobiles. The history of the newspaper is very vast and interesting. Along with providing information, the newspaper played an important role in the independence of India.

Newspaper is an integral and vital part of our lives. It is a messenger, it is announced, it is a source of knowledge, it is the broadcaster and it is also a powerful medium of awareness. It gives information about the events happening in the world, not just social and political. Along with news, this is also the medium of advertising. In this, advertisements for goods, services and recruitments are broadcasted. There are also missing, lost-found and government releases. Through the newspaper, we are aware of all the events around us.

Where on one side there are many advantages to the newspaper and on the other hand there are some drawbacks too. Sometimes newspapers use false and old stories to increase their credibility. Although people have to pay a monthly fee for the newspaper yet the main medium is advertising. Due to this, the newspapers print the ads without authenticity and are also get rid of by asking the readers to work with their discretion. Due to this, the masses sometimes have to take heavy losses too.

Without the newspaper, our contact will be cut off from the world. Of course, the newspaper is not only information and advertising but a powerful and all-encompassing medium of expressing your thoughts and reaching those thoughts to the world.

Firstly, playing games in childhood is a good way to have a sharp brain. Recent studies by the IMF have shown that jigsaw which is a tradition game increases the mental ability in those who play once a week. Moreover, gaming console such as Play station helps children to learn how to concentrate while making a quick decision. Therefore, it is clear playing games is a great way to develop the mind.

Secondly, children need healthy food to grow physically in a perfect way. They should consume varieties of fruits, vegetables, fresh milk, and meat, while they are nourished. The main reason is that the malnutrition definitely has some negative effects on their body. For instance, recent research in Africa has shown that physical development in 90% of African children was insufficient, and they suffer from physical weaknesses. Thus, there is no doubt that having a healthy meal lead to having body development.

To conclude, considering the above explanation, I firmly believe that either physical or mental development is important. Having healthy food and playing a game are good ways to improve them."

Technology has led to the development of machinery used in factories to reduce time and effort, but in turn has led to the elimination of a large number of labor; to replace their workplace, resulting in increased unemployment.

The development of technology in the military field has led to wars and the accompanying deaths and destruction resulting from the development of weapons.

Technology has reduced the power of family connections; communication among individuals has often become electronic, leading to emotional alienation of family members."
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"Due to the prevalence of the English languagein international business relations, as well asits role as a legal language within the EuropeanUnion, non-native English speaking law studentsand legal professionals are increasinglyseeking specialist training in legal English, andsuch training is now provided by universitiesand colleges which focus exclusively on legallanguage. In addition, special courses are offeredto those interested in learning or improvinglegal English.Traditional English language training maynot be sufficient to meet lawyers’ English languagerequirements. The main reason for thisis that such training generally ignores the waysin which English usage may be modified by theparticular demands of legal practice – and bythe conventions of legal English as a separatebranch of English in itself, i.e. legal Englishwhich now is a global phenomenon. It is alsoreferred to as legalese. Legalese is an Englishterm first used in 1914 for legal writing that isdifficult for lay people to read and understand,the implication being that said abstruseness isdeliberate for excluding the legally untrained(Noordin, Samad 2011: 1).But what is precisely meant by “LegalEnglish”? In W. Yeago‘s opinion, „Obviously, weare not talking about learning the substantivelaw of the hundreds of jurisdictions all overthe world. Rather we are talking about how tospeak and write about the law…. what expressions,collocations express most accurately yourmessage – the significance and precision, if youwill, of your communication“ (Yeago 2011: 1).English legalese is characterized by complexvocabulary, long sentences, numerous modifyingclauses, abstract ideas, and the layman’sneed to understand the document’s gist (Lee etal. 1999: 1).It is far from being easy for teachers toachieve the aims of teaching legal English."
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"While teaching English legalese, the teacherfaces numerous challenging tasks. Learninglegalese focuses more on language in contextthan on teaching grammar and language structuresas the students are learning the languageintegrated into a subject matter area importantto them „in order to communicate a set ofprofessional skills and to perform particularjob-related functions“ (Liuolienė, Metiūnienė2010: 111).However, teachers of legalese could beginwith simplified legal language. Some linguists(e.g., Debby S. Lee, a linguist and a lawyer) usethe term „legalized English“ meaning texts writtenspecially for teaching purposes in textbooks.Such texts are not authentic materials.The present article’s objectives are to defineauthentic legal materials (such as texts orrecordings of native speakers) and analyze theadvantages and disadvantages of two types ofsources while learning English legalese– authenticlegal materials and legalized Englishsources, i.e. ready-made textbooks/coursebooks and recordings adapted for a particularlevel for law students.The main method of the research is theanalysis of methodological references andsources as well as the method of comparison ofdifferent sources while teaching English legaleseto law students and practicing lawyers.Advantages of legal textbooksUndoubtedly, textbooks are an important resourcefor teachers in assisting students to learnlegal English. They are the foundation of schoolinstruction and the primary source of informationfor students and teachers. N. Noordinand A. A. Samad (Noordin, Samad 2011: 1)thorougly explain the necessity of textbooksin the teaching and learning process. Most oftheir ideas hold true for legal textbooks. In theopinion of the aforementioned authors, thetextbooks become the major source of contactthe students have with the language apart fromthe input provided by the teacher. They appearto be a necessary tool for law students as well.Textbooks allow teachers to easily design asyllabus with a clear organization and divisioninto units or sections. The continuity of theunits makes the course of legal English wellorganized,integrated and coherent. It is possibleto efficiently progress from learning easier legalvocabulary in context to more complicated oneusing the same textbook. Textbooks provideopportunities for students to develop their languagecompetence and skills through diverseactivities: reading legal texts, listening, writing,learning legal vocabulary and necessary phrasesfor communication, language of negotiationand presentations, etc. Thus, graded texts fromtextbooks can be safely and efficiently usedwhile teaching legal English."
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"Reading legalized textsIn teaching legal English, the legal vocabularyis usually found in texts which seem to be thegreatest lexical source. Legal textbooks providetexts which are frequently written speciallyfor learners and can be defined as legalizedtexts. They can be concise, based on certaintopics. Texts are usually supplemented by aglossary, comprehension questions, varioustasks, comments, notes, etc, which considerablyfacilitate the understand of the message, ideasand language of the text. This is, for example,the case with the legal textbook „AmericanLegal English“ by Debra S. Lee, Charles Halland Marsha Hurley in the preface of whichthe authors mention: „[...] what we have doneis provide a simplification of some aspects ofAmerican law and the vocabulary to discussthem along with opportunities for you to employthat vocabulary“ (Lee et al. 1999: 1). Theauthors think that learning about an area suchas law is hard work, the issues are complicated,the evidence is not always clear cut and thestatutes are frequently ambiguous. For this reason,the authors of the textbook present generalknowledge in content-specific texts; the citedstatutes may or even may not exist in a juris58Alvyda Liuolienė, Regina Metiūnienė Legal English and Adapted Legal Textsdiction. The authors point out that should anatorney teach this course or read this book, he/she may notice what might appear to be glaringholes in the law; but the purpose of the book is„to provide a basic legal overview for studentsand to exercise language use“ (Lee et al. 1999:2). The textbook strives to provide a frameworkfor practicing use of legal language. Thus, eventhough most legal textbooks oversimplify thelaw, they still retain legal vocabulary and teachthe legal language."
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"It is understandable that the first stage of learninglegal English should start with a legal textbook.However, teachers of legal English realizethat the use of authentic texts in a legal Englishclassroom can significantly contribute to thelearning experience disregarding the challengesof finding, understanding and developing tasksbased on authentic texts. Authentic texts havebeen defined by C. Wallace as “…real-life texts,not written for pedagogic purposes” (Berardo2006: 62). How do authentic legal texts differfrom legalized ones? Authentic legal texts havebeen written for native speakers and containauthentic language while legalized texts are especiallydesigned for language learning purposeswhose language may sometimes be artificialor simplified concentrating on something thathas to be taught.Authentic legal texts have many advantages.First of all, learners of legal English feel comfortablein the familiar subject area, the texts arerelevant to their studies, they are interesting tothe students as they deal with the specific areaof their profession – law. While reading thetexts written by native speakers, the studentsget a better idea about how language is used intheir profession in real life, outside the classroom.They are simultaneously provided withcultural and professional background. Thus, thelearners are usually highly motivated in readingauthentic materials as they will be able to applywhat they learn in their English classes totheir main field of study or professional work.Furthermore, according to A. S. Berardo (2006:62), while reading authentic texts, the learnersof the foreign language are confronted withreal, natural modern language used by nativespeakers, preferably the vocabulary – not justthe technical words, but the words and phraseswhich are the most useful in their professsion.Authentic sources may also contain a wide varietyof text types or language styles not foundin conventional teaching materials. Whilereading authentic texts, the students can feela sense of achievement which may encouragefurther reading.However, A. Krois Lindner (2008: 56) alsoindicates certain disadvantages reading authentictexts. She thinks that very suitable textscorresponding to the level of the students maynot always be readily accessible to the teacher.Many learners could agree that authentic textsare sometimes very difficult, „highly technical,written for a specialist audience with insiderknowledge“ (Krois-Lindner 2008: 56) and canbe very difficult even for the teacher to understand.Moreover, these texts frequently needto be supplemented by useful tasks, which isthe teacher‘s concern to design them (in comparison,the textbooks provide a great varietyof ready-made exercises)."
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"Among the great variety of authentic legal textsthe following ones could be mentioned: publiclyaccessible text materials such as law firm brochures,annual reports of courts, newspapers,magazines, legal journals, scientific articles, legalcases, legislation, legal scientific and fictionbooks, different websites, etc.One of the most invaluable source of autenticmaterials is the Internet. As the Internethas transformed communication around theworld, it is natural that it plays a major role inthe foreign language classroom. Teachers oflegal English are also very well aware that theuse of authentic Web materials in the classroomSANTALKA: Filologija, Edukologija 2012, 20(1): 56–64 59can significantly enrich the learning experience(Liuolienė, Žuvininkaitė 2008: 87) enliven theclass and create a more positive attitude towardlearning, „immersing the student in a multidimensionalEnglish experience“ (Kelly 2002: 1).The Internet, a modern day reality, seemsto be one of the most useful sources of workingwith authentic legal texts. Most teachers of legalEnglish would agree with S. A. Berardo (2006:62) who points out that „whereas newspapersand any other printed material date very quickly,the Internet is continuously updated, morevisually stimulating as well as being interactive,therefore promoting a more active approach toreading rather than a passive one“. Authentictexts enable learners to come into contact withthe real language and content rather than theform. Using authentic materials is a relativelyeasy and convenient way of improving not onlystudents’ general skills, but also their confidencein a real situation. It is also very easy to accessauthentic resources in the target language andnever has it been easier to create reusable resources(Kelly 2002: 1).Thus, taking authentic texts from theInternet has certain advantages in comparisonwith printed sources. First, nowadays moststudents enjoy working with computers andfind this way of learning highly motivatingand attractive (Liuolienė, Žuvininkaitė 2008:88). Furthermore, looking for materials in theInternet costs nothing, only time (Berardo 2006:62). In addition, the Internet provides versatilesources of authentic legal texts. Students canread the cases of the European Court of HumanRights or the European Court of Justice, thewebsites of distingushed law schools, articleswritten and edited by professional legal analystsproviding concise assessments of recentjudicial opinions and legislative and regulatoryactions, feature articles contributed by law firmpartners, in-house counsels, and law professors,regulatory and legislative matters, legaldocuments: contracts, licences, court pleadings:summonses, briefs, judgments, Acts of parliamentand subordinate legislation, EU legislationand other law-related issues. The teacher caneasily intergrate, combine and remodel legalmaterials to fit the needs of his students andsupplement authentic legal texts with speciallydesigned tasks. Consequently, many skills canbe developed alongside reading, such as listening,writing, learning grammar.Designing effective tasks for law studentsThe most challenging and difficult aspect ofusing authentic legal texts seems to be designingeffective tasks as authentic materials have notbeen meant for learning. It was mentioned abovethat usually the teacher has to design multipurposetasks for authentic texts to enhance theuse and value of such texts. One of the greatestadvantages of reading authentic texts is drawingvocabulary from texts. For this reason, a greatnumber of tasks can be designed: multiplechoice, gap fills, matchings, definitions, crosswords,word search, etc. which would enablelaw students to easier learn legal terminology.The Internet has endles possibilities todevelop coherent and fully intergrated authenticmaterials (Krois-Lindner 2008: 57).This could be illustrated by the www.l4law.orgsite which has recently been developed by lawand language professionals from Central andSoutheast Europe in cooperation with the U.S.Department of State. This is an on-line coursefor law students based on different topics. Forinstance, one of the units, Medical Malpractice,could illustrate the topic of Tort Law. This unitis based on authentic material, i.e. the real legalcase Cardwell v. Bechtol1. First, a video introducesthe case on which all the exercises of themodule are based. They include reading authenticlegal materials (the legal case of Cardwellv. Bechtol) to acquaint oneself with the law inthis area. Additional materials expand the legalknowledge of the subject area and include legalmaterials from around the world on this topic –authentic legislation of different countries. Legal"
,,,,,"technical and legal

There also are listening tasks followedby comprehension exercises. Recordings of nativespeakers help to develop listening skills ofthe students. Reading exercises include fillingin the gaps, rearranging passages or multiplechoice tasks having read extracts from authenticcases. Writing, one of the most important skillfor practicing attorneys, is taught through varioustasks concerning letter writing. Moreover,there is the glossary for checking the basicwords for the module and adding the new wordsthat law students learn as they go through thematerials. All the tasks are interactive, thus, theresults and the progress are visible immediately.The developers of this course aimed at teachinglegal English not only by introducing legal termsbut also other words related to law (the so-calledsemi-technical words. To conclude, this multimediacourse illustrates endless possibilities ofdesigning effective integrated tasks based onauthentic texts via the Internet.Teachers could easily enrich their classesby designing interactive exercises on legal vocabularythemselves by using a special computerprogramme Hot Potatoes (http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/halfbaked/) whose suite includes six applications,enabling the teachers to create interactivemultiple-choice, short-answer, jumbledsentence,crossword, matching/ordering andgap-fill exercises for the World Wide Web. Thisprogramme is invaluable for teaching vocabulary,developing reading skills. Even studentsthemselves can create tasks based on authentictexts or recordings."
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"Both reading and listening are considered asreceptive skills, as well as writing and speakingare productive abilities. In the teaching processthe development of listening skills is the part ofeffective communication as listening developsnot only competence in listening and speaking,it leads to critical thinking as well. However,very often students know and recognize thelegal terms and other semi-technical wordswhen they are presented visually but they donot recognize them in a spoken utterance. Themain cause of this communication problem isthe disability of listeners to recognize the wordsin the pace they are spoken, they are unable touse their legal vocabulary knowledge under thetime pressure. The awareness of the differencebetween the text which is meant to be heard andthe one to be read is of the greatest importance.Speech has such features as different accents andpronunciation, hesitations in speech delivery,incomplete utterances, rephrasing, unconventionalsyntax, etc. Readers normally deal withthe final product of writing and have little orno difficulty with recognition of words as theyhave clearly expressed beginnings and endingswhereas listeners have to process a speechstream consisting of series of words (Poelmans2003: 14).The variety of methods used by teachersand the types of legal (or legalized) materialsintroduced to students help them develop effectinglistening skills. Some modern linguistsrecommend the use of authentic legal materialsas a highly efficient means for the build-up ofprofessional vocabulary, enhancement of thequality of content in presentations and developmentof communicative skills as effectivecommunication skills are now really importantin every aspect of our life, especially in a professionalcareer. By using authentic legal or legalizedlistening materials the students are giventhe possibility to develop the skills needed tocomprehend and to use the language that iscommonly found in real life situations, theyare assisted in understanding the content andthe purposes of the different types of spokengenres in a legal context, such as job interviews,lawyer-client interviews, providing advice, professionaldiscussions with colleagues, negotiations,seminars and conferences.Legalized listening texts are usually providedby the authors of modern legal languageSANTALKA: Filologija, Edukologija 2012, 20(1): 56–64 61textbooks (it must be noted, that very oftenthey are also supplemented with authenticlegal listening materials), whereas, authenticlegal texts have not been specially prepared forlegal English learners and they are deliveredvia technologies like radio, television, video,the Internet or CD-ROM. The Internet offersa wide range of listening practice for students.It is particularly useful for teachers teachingprofessional English in a very precise area – law,as Internet users can access variety of materialproduced by native speakers. The most usefulwebsites which are used to build up legaland political vocabulary as well as developinglistening and communicative skills are http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian, http://www.nytimes.com/, http://www.bbc.co.uk/, whereoriginal examples of formal authentic language(e.g. inauguration speeches of the USApresidents, the Queen’s State Opening speeches,prime minister David Cameron at PMQs, etc.),details of lawsuits and opinions on differentpolitical and legal issues, newscasts, interviews,presentations, reports uttered in different accentscan be found. Such websites as www.lawbore.net and www.venables.co.uk give accessto short videos illustrating legal arguments andprovide links to other sites useful for studentsof legal English. The greatest advantage of theInternet is that audio material that is available ismuch more up-to-date than DVD or recordedmaterials, it takes into account not only recentlanguage reforms but also forthcoming changesto the legal system in the United Kingdom – forexample, there is access to the latest news asmany radio stations offer the possibility to listento live broadcast.As well as offering live broadcasts, thereare opportunities to listen to recorded audioand video clips on the Internet or DVD, whichmeans that students can work at their ownpaste and listen to more complicated sectionsof the recording several times, and to readaccompanying transcripts before, after or duringthe listening (How to use the internet todevelop listening skills 2010). A great numberof authentic legal or legalized recordings onvarious issues included into the law studiescurriculum had been collected and attachedto the course book “Listening for Law” byA. Liuolienė, R. Metiūnienė and D. Užpalienė.The authors of the course book created tasksbased on listening to legal issues, the tasks are ofgreat help for teachers and students to developlistening and speaking skills on topics such astypes and sources of law, international treaties,the European Union and state governing issues,constitution, human rights and democracy, civiland criminal procedures, contracts and corporations,etc. (Liuolienė et al. 2011).Moreover, listening to legal texts is successfullyused as an alternative way of introducing anew topic or new legal terms (rather than usinga text) and developing note-taking skills."
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"Listening to authentic legal or legalized materialsdemands not only the awareness ofthe peculiarities of English legalese and someinsider knowledge, but also particular skillsthat are developed through pre-, while- andpost-listening activities related to the providedlistening material. In pre-listening stage ashort discussion can be initiated as to what thestudents know and what they think of the topicbefore they listen to the text (activating worldand personal knowledge). Pre-listening stagemay contain satellite activities which focus onpronunciation, mastering legal vocabulary, readingand comprehension of information piecesrelated to the central legal text.While listening to the conversation, thestudents have to focus on listening; therefore,the tasks should be very precise and explicit.Careful selection of meaningful tasks, that catersto developing specific listening skills, helpto concentrate on listening and comprehensionof the text, retrieving specific information andunderstanding separate legal terms. Then thestudents can be asked to use whatever informationthey gathered from the text to have anextended discussion in a post-listening stage62 Alvyda Liuolienė, Regina Metiūnienė Legal English and Adapted Legal Texts(allowing for more individualization and criticalcomments to be developed).Different listening testing techniques chosenby the teacher, such as “completing charts/forms/tables”, “multiple choice”, “ordering”,“marking statements”, “true/false statements”,“extending lists”, open-ended questions”, “listeningfor specific information”, “listening foroverall understanding”, “listening for gist”, “takingnotes”, etc. provide the right level of challenge:the balance between the complexity of thelanguage required for the task and the student’sability is appropriate to allow for accuracy, fluencydevelopment and the language development.These tasks encourage the students not only tolisten to the information but also to utter it orally(Metiūnienė, Užpalienė 2008: 111).When designing lessons and teaching materialsto further develop listening comprehensionskills, students need to be motivated and staymotivated. This is best accomplished by determiningthe suitability of the listening materials,the techniques used in classroom teaching, andthe use of authentic legal materials.Numerous listening and speaking activitieshelp build fluency through the integrationof reading and writing. The skills obtainedthrough these activities are widely used bystudents in their further studies: they makeindividual presentations, address the audience,present projects and participate in professionaldiscussions using relevant communication skillsboth in general English and legal English."
,,,,,"technical and legal

At the initial stage of teachingEnglish legalese legalized materials preparedspecially for teaching purposes in textbooksseem to be more appropriate as they are adaptedfor a particular level for law students. Whereasin more advanced levels, the teachers of legalEnglish realize that the use of authentic textsin a legal English classroom can significantlycontribute to the learning experience disregardingthe challenges of finding, understandingand developing tasks based on authentic legaltexts. When used effectively, legal and legalizedmaterials can improve the teaching process andare highly recommended to teachers of legalEnglish because:−−legal English learners feel comfortable inthe familiar subject area;−−with reading the texts written by professionalnative speakers, as well as listeningto authentic legal texts, the real world isbrought into the classroom and the studentsget a better idea about how languageis used in their profession in real life;−−professional language learners are confrontedwith real, natural modern languageused by native speakers, preferablythe vocabulary: legal and semi-technicalwords;−−students can feel a sense of achievementand confidence which may encouragefurther reading;−−well prepared communicative types oflistening to authentic legal texts make oralcommunication more effective;−−the use of authentic materials stimulatesand motivates learners to comprehendthe content of an oral text because thepractical benefits of understanding suchauthentic language material are obvious.The sources of authentic texts significantlydepend on the area of law. The teacher has awide choice of authentic materials: companybrochures, annual reports, newspapers, letters,magazines, journals, scientific articles, legalcases, legislation, books, different websites,recordings of authentic speeches, etc. For numerousreasons the most invaluable source ofauthentic legal materials is the Internet."
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"The paper takes into consideration some aspects of the process of translation of legal texts, examined both from an interlinguistic and an intralinguistic perspective. As regards interlingual translation, specific linguistic constraints are discussed, as well as influences deriving from different drafting traditions and legal cultures. The paper also takes into consideration the phenomenon of intralinguistic translation with special attention devoted to the strategies of popularization often adopted in this process. The analysis carried out shows the complexity of the translation of legal texts, which is greatly conditioned by specific factors strictly depending not only on the different cultural, linguistic and legal environments in which it takes place but also on the target users with their own legal culture and specialized knowledge."
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"Legal translation has been in great demand in the last few decades around the world owing to globalization and increased contact and exchange between people and states (Gotti & Šarčević, 2006). Indeed, many of the texts in use at a local level nowadays are the result of a process of translation of more general documents formulated at an international level. This is the consequence of the fact that in the context of co-operation and collaboration at an international level, law too is fast assuming an international perspective rather than remaining a purely domestic concern. This phenomenon may have relevant consequences in an international context, which often involves documents written in one language but incorporating statutes and regulations issued by different countries.
The complexity of the interlinguistic rendering of a legal text is particularly due to the fact that the translation from one language to another is generally bijural, due to the differences in the source and the target legal and linguistic systems. This is the reason why a legal translation is mainly assessed on the basis of its adequacy to its communicative purpose in the target culture. This is also valid in many multilingual (but unijural) countries, in which all translations of a statute have the same authentic status and are considered parallel texts. Thus, the principle of legal equivalence (Beaupré, 1986) has emerged, which underlines the consideration of the legal effects that a translated text will have in the target culture. Šarčević (2000) emphasizes the need for legal translation not only of
Vol. 4(1)(2016): 5-21 6
THE TRANSLATION OF LEGAL TEXTS: INTERLINGUISTIC AND INTRALINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVES
achieving equal effect and equal meaning but also of preserving the original intent of the legal text.
Although legal documents in all languages address similar issues, they do so in distinctive ways, because of the different languages in which they are constructed and the cultural differences of the societies in question and of their legal systems. A legal translation is particularly challenging not only because of the culture-laden nature of legal discourse, but also because of a need for formal correspondence between equally authoritative versions of the same text. As Simms observes,
[...] the law must be seen to be the law, the same in all cases, regardless of the language in which it is expressed. This means that both literality and functionality are demanded of the translation: literality, because accuracy of semantic substitution is what lends the law credibility as a single entity; and functionality, since the law must (by definition of justice) perform the same function for all those who live under it. But [...] literality and functionality tend to pull in opposite directions. (Simms, 1997: 19, emphasis in the original)
Legal translation is a very complex process, as it relies on many factors, the most important being linguistic and legal interpretation of the source legal text as a whole and its rendering in an appropriate equivalent text in another language. As Chromá rightly asserts:
Translating legal texts means transferring legal information from one language and culture into another language and culture, considering the differences in the legal systems and the purpose of translation. [...] Since the legal information contained in the source text (ST) is often vague, indefinite, and may also be ambiguous, it should be interpreted within the source language (SL) first, the interpreted information translated into the target language (TL), and, finally, the translated information conformed to the purpose of translation and genre of the target text (TT). (Chromá, 2007: 198- 199)7Therefore the translator is required to undertake a process of conceptual analysis by means of which he is able to identify and assess the most important differences between the source and target legal systems as they are expressed in the text to be translated. This conceptual analysis will enable the translator to find the most suitable equivalent in the target language that will best serve the purpose of translation."
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"The lack of correspondence of specific features from different linguistic systems may create considerable problems in the formulation and interpretation of legal texts. For example, two linguistic features stand out in Chinese when compared with European languages:
1. The absence of inflection (e.g. plural = singular nouns / verbs)
2. The possible omission of grammatically significant indicators (e.g. definite / indefinite articles)
Therefore, when translating Chinese texts into English, important decisions have to be made as regards the articles to be inserted and whether nouns are to be rendered by a singular or plural form. Cao (2008: 114) gives the following example of a clause, which literally translated from Chinese would look like this: cause serious environmental pollution accident. This may be rendered in English in two different ways:
 cause a serious environmental pollution accident  cause serious environmental pollution accidentsThe adoption of either of these formulations is not at all neutral as it would imply a different kind of responsibility on the part of the offender: does a person have to cause more than one such accident to be criminally liable or just one accident is sufficient? The Chinese legal authorities are aware of this problem and have tried to cope with it by suggesting possible solutions. For example, section 7(2) of the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (1997), Cap. 1 of the Laws of Hong Kong provides that “[w]ords and expressions in the singular include the plural and words and expressions in the plural include the singular”. However, this does not totally solve the problem as this interpretation does not imply that the singular form of a word has exactly the same meaning of the plural form of that word, as in some cases the words and expressions in the singular do not include the plural, and vice versa. The choice of either a singular or a plural rendering is often based on the interpretation of the context. So it is not infrequent to find that the same Chinese word is translated in different ways in the same translated text. For example, the same Chinese word renshi is rendered as persons (e.g. “persons named”, section 3(1) Cap. 159D) and person (e.g. “person with a disability”, section 2(7) Cap. 487) in Bilingual Laws Information Systems. This alternation often depends on the translator’s personal choice, and even suggestions coming from legal experts (such as the one given below) do not prove to be totally safe:
It follows that the mere fact that the reading of words in a section suggests an emphasis on singularity as opposed to plurality is not enough to exclude
8 Vol. 4(1)(2016): 5-21
THE TRANSLATION OF LEGAL TEXTS: INTERLINGUISTIC AND INTRALINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVES
plurality. Words in the singular will include the plural unless contrary intention appears. But in considering whether a contrary intention appears there need be no confinement of attention to any one particular section of an Act. It must be appropriate to consider the section in its setting in the legislation and furthermore to consider the substance and tenor of the legislation as a whole. (Hong Kong Privy Council, as cited in Cheng, Sin, & Cheng, 2014: 29)
Another translation problem caused by the linguistic structures of Chinese is that words in a noun phrase can be linked without using a conjunction such as the English and or or. This may create structural ambiguity. See, for example, the following literal translation from Chinese (Cao, 2008: 115): resulting in serious loss to public private property. Two interpretations of these words may be given, with very different legal consequences:
 to public and private property  to public or private property
Another example of ambiguity is provided by the following words: personal injury death (Cao, 2008: 115), which could be rendered as personal injury and death or personal injury or death. This double possibility of translation is relevant when deciding whether death must be involved in committing the offence.
The different structural features of the source and target languages may also induce the translator to alter the phrasing and word order of the original formulation. For example, the alterations visible in the following quotations may be due to the syntactic differentiations existing between Italian and English:"
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"Important elements of a particular legal system are its drafting tradition and its stylistic conventions. These may influence legal discourse significantly, as can be seen in the differentiation between civil law and common law texts: the former are mainly characterized by generality, while the latter prefer particularity (Driedger, 1982). This stylistic difference derives from a basic conceptual differentiation underlying the two legal systems: in the civil law system the judiciary is entrusted with the task of applying the general principles outlined in the civil code to specific real-life situations; this requirement therefore privileges stylistic choices such as
Vol. 4(1)(2016): 5-219 
MAURIZIO GOTTI
generality of expression. The common law system, instead, is based on the principle of precedence, by means of which the decisions taken by one judge become binding on all subsequent similar cases; this system therefore regards certainty of expression as the most valued quality in legal drafting (Tiersma, 1999). This differentiation between the two legal systems implies that the rendering of a text from one system to the other requires a procedure that does not correspond to mere translation but to a more complex process of ‘legal transposition’ (Šarčević, 2000). An evident differentiation in drafting conventions can be seen, for example, in the way juridical obligation is signalled. This concept is traditionally expressed by modal shall in English legal discourse:
(3) 1. States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child’s or his or her parent’s or legal guardian’s race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status.
2. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child’s parents, legal guardians, or family members. (CRC1 2, emphasis added)
In other languages (e.g. French and Italian) instead, legal discourse often adopts a present indicative to state legal provisions, thus emphasizing the actuality and applicability of the legal provision and also implying that the law draws its force from the natural order of things rather than expressing an order imposed by human agents:"
,,,,,"technical and legal

permanence of traditional linguistic traits, which are preserved even when they disappear from general language. Old formulae are preferred to newly-coined words because of their centuries-old history and highly codified, universally accepted interpretations. These ‘frozen’ patterns of language – which are sometimes referred to as ‘routines’ (Hatim & Mason, 1997) – allow little variation in form and can only be rendered by means of similar routines in the target language, as can be seen in the following examples: salvo che la legge disponga altrimenti > unless otherwise provided by law / salvo quanto previsto dall’art. [...] > without prejudice to the provision of Article [...] (Gialuz et al., 2014: 77).
Another case of divergence in drafting traditions may be seen in the high level of redundancy which characterizes some legal languages, generally due to the pleonastic use of lexical items. For example, English legal drafters often employ two interchangeable terms for the same concept: e.g. new and novel, false and untrue, made and signed, terms and conditions, able and willing. This phenomenon is specific to the English tradition, so it may cause some problems to translators into other languages that are not so richly equipped with synonymic terms. This is the case, for example, of Czech law, in which no such concept as expressed by the quasi-doublet of execute and deliver exists (Chromá, 2014)."
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"Legal terminology is so culture-bound (the reasons being at the same time historical, sociological, political and jurisprudential) that a satisfactory translation of all the legal terms of a text from one context to another is at times impossible. David underlines this difficulty with a few examples:
To translate into English technical words used by lawyers in France, in Spain, or in Germany is in many cases an impossible task, and conversely there are no words in the languages of the continent to express the most elementary notions of English law. The words common law and equity are the best examples thereof; we have to keep the English words [...] because no words in French or in any other language are adequate to convey the meaning of these words, clearly linked as they are to the specific history of English law alone. (David, 1980: 39)
Even the interpretation of such common legal terms as contract, consumer and damage may differ from country to country. As regards the latter term, Heutger (2008) points out that the type of damage which qualifies for compensation in one jurisdiction is not necessarily recognized as such in another, even in legal systems that are closely related and share the same language, such as Austria and Germany. Another example provided by Heutger of a common term having various meanings is guarantee / garantie / garanzia / Garantie, a term of frequent usage in many European countries, which may however have several interpretations:
warranty, legal rights, extra rights of a buyer in case of defective goods added to the buyer’s legal rights, a security, a pure consumer guarantee, or a confirmation that something will not change. (Heutger, 2008: 9-10)
The adoption of a particular term instead of another may give rise to ambiguity and misinterpretation. Several examples of this are given by Fletcher (1999), who examines the translation into various languages of the English text of the European Convention on Human Rights. For instance, the translation provided for the expression fair and regular trial into juicio justo y imparcial (Spanish) and procès juste et équitable (French) is not satisfactory, as the use of the non-equivalent adjectives regular (English) / imparcial (Spanish) / équitable (French) can easily show. The same could be said for the rendering of the concept of reasonableness, basic in common law systems, where expressions such as reasonable steps, reasonable measures, reasonable person and proof beyond a reasonable doubt frequently occur. This concept, instead, when translated into languages spoken in countries adopting a civil law system is considered too vague and its rendering as ragionevole, raisonnable or vernünftig often gives rise to criticism and dissatisfaction.
Other excellent examples of translation discrepancies can easily be found in texts relating to the process of building a common European legal framework. For example, translators into English find it difficult to express such culturally-specific French collocations as acteurs sociaux, acteurs économiques, acteurs institutionnels, acteurs publics, acteurs politiques, which have no direct equivalent in the target language (Salmasi, 2003: 117), and they sometimes transliterate terms or create calques from one language into another, relying on the false premise of a very close relationship between similar lexemes in different languages (see the examples of transmettre / transmit and prévoir / foresee in Seymour, 2002). Another case of translation divergence which implies important conceptual differentiations is the following, which occurs in the Preamble to the UN’s Convention of the Rights of the Child (1989) and its Italian translation:
(5) Bearing in mind that the peoples of the United Nations have, in the Charter, reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person, and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom [...]. (CRC Preamble, emphasis added)

that the rights mentioned in the text only refer to male children and do not apply to female ones.
Sometimes terms from different legal contexts are only partially equivalent, as they cover a mere part of the meaning of the ‘corresponding’ term and are thus not to be considered fully interchangeable. This is the case, for example, of the French term droit des obligations, which – although it is often rendered as contract law in English – indeed covers a broader semantic area regarding not only contract law, but also restitution law and the law of torts (Mac Aodha, 2014). This is the reason why the search for a functional equivalent requires a certain amount of legal knowledge of both the source and the target legal systems in order to assess whether the functions of a terminological unit in the source legal system and that in the target text are identical. Chromá (2007) illustrates this point by means of three examples:"

A good example is the requirement of good faith as a criterion for assessing the (un)fair character of consumer contracts. The concept is also present in most continental civil law systems: e.g. bonne foi or buona fede. However,
“although the principle of good faith is derived from common sources in Roman law, there are significant differences in how the notion is interpreted by national case-law and legal scholars even in the civil law countries [...]. On the other hand, English contract law does not recognize a general legal requirement of good faith, as a result of which the UK was ‘forced’ to introduce the concept in its national transposing statute for the purpose of the Directive [93/13/EECC]”.

When it is impossible to single out an exactly corresponding concept in the target language that is immediately insertable in the translation, the translator may decide to recur to a functional equivalent (Nida & Taber, 1982). A relevant example is given by Garzone and Catenaccio (2013) as regards the word arrondissement, which refers to an administrative area in many French-speaking countries. The word used in the English version of the Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities is borough. Although this word has a variable meaning across the English-speaking world, in the case of Montreal it is perfectly equivalent to arrondissement because in the Canadian system the correspondence between the two words has been conventionally established. In the Italian version, instead, the expression used is zona amministrativa, as this is the term commonly used to refer to a city’s administrative area.
In cases in which there is no synonymic equivalent in the two languages involved, the translator may decide to coin a calque, thus filling a semantic gap in the target language. This is the case, for instance, of the expression minorités visibles or visible minorities, strictly connected with the Canadian political tradition, which – as aptly pointed out by Garzone and Catenaccio (2013) – is defined in the Canadian Employment Equity Act 1995 (last amended on 29/06/2012) as “persons, other than Aboriginal people, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour”, in contrast with invisible minorities which are determined by invisible traits, such as language or nationality. This expression was transferred into the Italian translation of Canadian texts as minoranze visibili, and has then spread also in EU documents to refer to minorities and empowerment.
However, recourse to a calque is not always a viable solution. An example is provided by Garzone and Catenaccio (2013) with the French word âgism, a term which is also present in American English as ageism, originally referring to prejudice against older adults and now used to refer to all forms of discrimination based on age. While these two words (âgism and ageism) are used in the French and English versions of the Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities, the Italian version recurs to a periphrasis (la discriminazione per età) as the English- derived calque ageismo would not have been easy to understand for Italians as it has not yet appeared in dictionaries of the Italian language.
There are hidden problems and complexity even when translating some seemingly simple words. As mentioned by Beaupré (1986), in a Canadian case (Olavarria v Minister of Manpower and Immigration [1973]) the Court was asked to decide whether the word ‘counsel’ included non-lawyers. Indeed, the French version of the relevant act referred to a stricter right to an avocat. Eventually, the Court decided that the word ‘counsel’ in the English language has a sense that is wide enough to include an adviser whether or not he is a lawyer, and that therefore in the Act in question the word had been used in this wider sense. A similar case is reported by Cheng, Sin, and Cheng (2014) as regards the translation into Chinese of the English terms barrister and solicitor:

,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"An interesting lexical issue that exemplifies how ideological problems may affect translation decisions regards the rendering of gender-related terms. Garzone and Catenaccio (2013) discuss this issue when they comment on the translation of the expression les citoyennes et les citoyens, recurring in the Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities. According to these scholars, the use of both feminine and masculine nouns indicates the drafter’s clear intention to avoid recourse to the masculine in order to highlight the mention of women as independent subjects. As English does not have two gender-specific words for this concept, the translator decided to use the neutral term citizen. Although it would not have been impossible to translate les citoyennes et les citoyens as female and male citizens, the translator probably considered this choice too unnatural and thus avoided it. This is not the case of the Italian version, which presents le cittadine e i cittadini as the two gender-related words exist in this language.
At times some explicitation strategies have to be adopted, particularly in those cases in which relevant cultural distances exist between the two juridical systems. This is the case, for example, of the translation into English of the Italian Codice di Procedura Penale (Gialuz et al., 2014) in the making of which the translators have disambiguated the polysemy of several Italian terms by providing different words in English. Here are a few examples:
(7) - camera di consiglio, translated as in chambers to mean ’simplified proceedings which shall take place without presence of the audience’, but as in closed session when referring instead to the physical place where the decision of the court is delivered; [...] - fatto/fatti, translated as either criminal act, alleged offence, event, fact or offence depending on its specific meaning in the context of occurrence; [...]
- the verb pubblicare, translated as publish when meaning ‘print’ [...] but as deliver when meaning ‘make public, express in words’ [...];
Vol. 4(1)(2016): 5-2115 
MAURIZIO GOTTI
- the verb procedere (when referred to the judge), translated either as order [...] or as decide on + the specification the aforementioned issue (or a repetition) [...]. (Gialuz et al., 2014: 71-72)
In the translation of the same text, explicitation strategies also became necessary whenever there was a need to disambiguate potentially ambiguous pronouns or gender-neutral nouns. An example of the former case is the following, where the ambiguity of the pronoun stesso was made explicit through the repetition of the noun pardon:
(8) Il pubblico ministero computa altresì il periodo di pena detentiva espiata per un reato diverso, quando la relativa condanna è stata revocata, quando per il reato è stata concessa amnistia o quando è stato concesso indulto, nei limiti dello stesso.
The public prosecutor shall also calculate the period of custodial penalty which has been served for a different offence, if the related conviction has been revoked, if amnesty and pardon have been granted for the offence, within the limits of the pardon. (Gialuz et al., 2014: 61, emphasis in the original)
Another type of strategy that translators may adopt is to change the syntactic structure of a clause in order to facilitate the decoding of the target text. Such strategy may lead them to break a long sentence into two separate sentences or to
alter the syntactic structure of a particular clause. In the following quotation, for example, a parenthetical restrictive clause interrupting the main sentence of the 16 Italian text has been substituted with a subordinate if-clause in the English text:
(9) Il pubblico ministero, quando non propone impugnazione, provvede con decreto motivato da notificare al richiedente.
If the Public Prosecutor does not submit an application for appellate remedy, he shall issue a reasoned decree to be served on the applicant. (Gialuz et al., 2014: 66, emphasis in the original)."
,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"The information process established by popularization has often been compared to that of translation (Liao, 2013). Both of these involve the transformation of a source text into a derived text. It is impossible to conceptualize the target of a translation without a source and, similarly, every popularization implies the presence of a specialized text. The popularization process is a kind of redrafting that does not alter the disciplinary content – object of the transaction – as much as its language, which needs to be remodelled to suit a new target audience. In the process, information is transferred linguistically in a way similar to periphrasis or to intralingual translation. Indeed, intralingual translation consists in replacing a

THE TRANSLATION OF LEGAL TEXTS: INTERLINGUISTIC AND INTRALINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVES
intralingual translation and the rewording of concepts found in popularization is also favoured by the widespread use of metaphor and simile in popularizing processes. Both techniques establish a direct link with the public’s general knowledge, which makes the content easier to identify.
A trial by jury represents a typical example of the knowledge asymmetries that may exist among the various participants, some of whom are legal experts and some non-experts. The former category comprises professionals such as lawyers and judges, while jurors and witnesses usually have a non-legal background. As jurors and witnesses play a relevant role in a trial, it is of the utmost importance that they should be able to understand all the communication going on in court, including the legal terms used and their implied concepts. As Anesa’s (2012) analysis has shown, there are various moments in which both the judge and the lawyers devote time and efforts to explain the legal jargon the jurors come across.
One of such moments is at the beginning of the trial, when the jury is instructed about the various procedures used in court. The great importance of this phase has often been underlined, as misunderstanding of legal principles may have a detrimental effect on the outcome of the trial. This explains the vast literature related to the formulation of jury instructions, aiming in particular at the improvement of their comprehensibility (Dumas, 2000; Ellsworth & Reifman, 2000; Heffer, 2008; Tiersma, 2010). As the understanding of these instructions is crucial, the judge often offers to supply further information in case of doubt or incomprehension:"
,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"THE COURT: The next phase of the trial is another orientation. This orientation, however, is a little more specific, because it now deals with some of the dos and don’ts of this new job that you have. Like everything else in this state, this has been reduced to a script for me to read. When you realize that this script was prepared by lawyers and judges, it will soon become very apparent to you that this is not only not the most entertaining material you’ve ever heard, but, in addition to that, it might sound confusing and a little convoluted. Don’t worry about it. We’re going to be talking about very basic concepts, and I will try to interject where all the legalese is some common-sense approach to this."
,,,,,"technical and legal

The language he uses is simple and the tone is conversational and humorous, comprising sarcastic remarks (“Like everything else in this state, this has been reduced to a script for me to read”) and euphemistic comments (“this is not [...] the most entertaining material you’ve ever heard”). The judge is aware of performing a popularizing task and likens his present function to that of a law lecturer:"

  similarity between

And from time to time a question might be asked and the one lawyer will think that the answer to that question might be objectionable for some reason. So that lawyer is going to say objection and will give me a reason why I should either sustain or overrule the objection. Now, the reason I’m basically here is sort of the referee of this match that’s going on. So my job is to make the call. If I overrule the objection, what that means is you’re going to hear the question and you will hear the answer."

,,,,,"technical and legal
education",,,,,,,,,"As can be seen from the investigation carried out above, the translation of legal texts is a very complex procedure, greatly conditioned by specific factors strictly depending on the different cultural, linguistic and legal environments in which it takes place. The discussion of certain linguistic and textual aspects of legal texts carried out in this paper has provided interesting insights into how translation procedures may be influenced by different target users with their own legal culture and drafting traditions.
This process of adaptation to audiences having different degrees of legal competence can be seen at work also in intralinguistic contexts, as shown by the analysis carried out in this paper as regards the popularization strategies adopted in jury trials. In this case, the communication of knowledge implies important changes in the cognitive dimension, deriving from the interaction between specialized knowledge and its popularization. This explains the adoption of carefully-chosen strategies of knowledge management on the part of the various professionals involved, which presupposes important effects in terms of
understanding of the legal procedures and of the interpretation of the criminal facts and intentions being discussed at the trial.
The analysis reported here also highlights the need for a better understanding of linguistic and textual phenomena closely linked to a cross- cultural perspective. Indeed, translations of legal texts have often been shown to display significant traces of the adjustment and adaptation of the source documents to the legal language and culture of the target users. The rendering of the final text is the result of conscious and deliberate decisions taken by translators, thus confirming the important conditioning role that local constraints play in the translation of legal texts. As globalization trends intensify, the role of national legal systems is likely to be diminished by transnational legal frameworks. However, contrary to the general expectation, legal translation has not been simplified, as a complex scheme of reference has become necessary that includes both legal and linguistic competence on various levels."

,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"A barrister and solicitor have the same education. Thereafter they split. Solicitors take a one year course called the Legal Practice Course (LPC) and then must undertake two years apprenticeship with a solicitor, called “the training contract” (but still widely referred to as “article” by older members of the profession). At this stage young solicitors are paid salaries and are referred to as trainee solicitors.
2. No one is let loose on clients unsupervised until training complete. At the end of the “articles”, the student becomes a solicitor and is “admitted to the roll”. The ‘roll’ is a list of people qualified to be a solicitor. It is kept on behalf of the ‘Master of the Rolls’ whose main job is being the head of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales.

While pupilage provides a somewhat robust introduction to life as a barrister, the transition to tenancy is the real beginning of a barrister's independent career. It is not simply a matter of getting your name on the door. Overnight a young barrister acquires a different status. It is now where the real responsibility begins. Sometimes junior tenants are 'led' by their seniors (i.e. they assist them in large, important cases) but generally they are responsible for their own cases and clients.
Because junior tenants are self-employed, the flow of work can be spas- modic and the hours irregular. They may be given very little notice of court appearances. Briefs can arrive by fax in the evening, leaving little time to pre- pare for a case to be heard a hundred miles away the next morning. However, what is lost in terms of social life and excessive traveling will be gained in the sense that they are getting enough work. In addition to normal expenses, self- employed barristers also need to pay their share towards the cost of running chambers."

But what has stayed the same is that non-law graduates have to have a certain founding in law before they can qualify, before they can take the final examination which law graduates take. And that has not changed.
One thing that has changed over the years is that local authorities are less prone to finance it now than was the case then. And for example the large London firms will actually pay non-law graduates to take what is now called the Common Professional Examination. It was called Part One in my day, but there is still a significant number of non-law graduates coming into the profes- sion, and that will continue to be the case.
By comparison with other professional people in England and Wales, so- licitors are some way down the league in terms of income. I think that for ex- ample dentists, doctors and surveyors, are all significantly better off, and ac- countants too in the recent survey which I didn't read personally, but I heard this on the grapevine.
I think the pro . . . is, one of the things you’ve got to remember about this is that a very large number of solicitors in England and Wales are in small firms and are self-employed. Their clients are not particularly wealthy people
and one has to look at it in the context that the clients can only afford to pay what their pockets will stand. And therefore no matter how well-qualified or expert the professional person is, if his paymaster isn’t a large multinational corporation, he can’t charge the earth, because the client can't afford to pay it. I think that's worthwhile bearing in mind.
. . . there was a client of the firm who lived within walking distance, and so when the post was taken out to be dropped into the box at something like. I don't know, say 4.30 in the afternoon, when the first lot of post went, there was a letter by hand to this particular chap, and it, would be dropped in at his shop near to the postbox, and before the girl who had dropped it off could be back at the office, he'd not only opened the envelope and read it but then phoned the chap who'd written it to discuss it with him, all literally within a minute or so of receiving the letter.
And it's not uncommon for the phone to go potty on a Monday morning simply because people have received letters and have thought about it over the weekend and as soon as 9.00 or 9.30 arrives they're on the phone because they feel that it's their privilege to talk about it first thing in the week. And if fifty people do that all at the same time, life isn't too much fun, first thing on a Monday morning, so, I don't know, one can smile about it, but it's not good for the indigestion . . ."

my asking?

Stephen: No, no, he just keeps phoning up and keeping on at us – it’s really
getting us down.
Charles: Yes, quite so. Well a couple of things there. Firstly, he must inform
you in writing, or else it’s not legal. And after that, since you pay monthly he’s got to give you a month before you leave anyway. Now secondly, he’s not allowed to keep pestering you like this until he has got a court order for possession – you could sue him for harassment.
Stephen: Oh, I see, that’s interesting to know.
Charles: Now do you happen to know his reasons for wanting to regain pos-
session of the house?
Stephen: No, we assumed he wanted to sell or something, but ...
Charles: Yes, because if he needs it for himself or a member of his family
then I'm afraid you’ve got problems. Otherwise it seems to me that you’ve
probably got a pretty good chance of staying put, at least for a year or so. Stephen: That would be wonderful, because we leave college then, anyway. Charles: But er, I have to say that this whole issue is so complex that you’d

Mr Andrews: Well, as you see, your question concerns the essence of mod- ern Law, its historical and political backgrounds. In short, Common Law has been adopted by many Commonwealth countries and most of the United States and Continental Law has developed in most of continental Europe, Latin America and many countries in Asia and Africa, strongly in- fluenced by Europe.

Mr Jack: Ah, yes, excuse for butting in, but what’s the particular distinction between these two legal systems?

Mr Charles: Well, you see, despite a tradition of private law that resembled principles of judicial precedent the lawmakers of Japan have adopted criminal and civil codes closely based on the existing French models in their attempts to modernize Japanese Law. Thus Japanese Law has been in- fluenced by both Common Law and Continental Law.
Mrs Kate: Thanks a lot, but I’ve heard some changes have been taken place in Chinese Law.
Mr Charles: Yes, certainly. In Chinese Law courts historically are regarded as political instruments, used both to control theft and violence and to deal with political opponents. But recently citizens in some areas have been en- couraged to seek legal redress in disputes with other citizens, for example over consumer matters. Attempts have been made to codify Chinese Law, but so far there has been little progress.

I think now I accept the idea of a royal family, because they can function and operate outside politics. What I mean by that is that they're not going to be touched by po- litical scandal, in the way that a president, for example, might be, President of the United States, for example.
But although I approve of the idea of a monarchy, I don't approve of the monarchy we have in Britain at the moment. I'm against them personally, if you like. I think the problem we have with our monarchy is that they are greedy, I would say. They are lazy. They display their wealth in a very osten- tatious and vulgar way. They keep their wealth and their treasures well away from the public. They don't contribute to the public good.
I think I would be in favour of a monarchy of the sort you find in other countries in Northern Europe: in Scandinavia, in Holland, for example, per- haps in Belgium. Because those royal families set a good example. They're modest. They work hard. You know, you hear, in England you hear all the time, 'Oh, don't you feel sorry for the Royal Family. They work so hard.' I simply don't believe this. I would love to swap my job for their job any day. I don't think they work hard.
The other thing that I don't like about our Royal Family is the fact that they now seem to behave in, you know, like actors in a soap opera. That they've become vulgar. They've become popular and at the same time, they've become vulgar. They're not dignified. And I do think that a monarchy, although it should be modest, it should be dignified.

   Reaffirming that no Member should be prevented from adopting or enforcing measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life  or health, subject to the requirement that these measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between Members where the same conditions prevail or a disguised restriction on international trade;

   Desiring to improve the human health, animal health and phytosanitary situation in all Members;

   Noting that sanitary and phytosanitary measures are often applied on the basis of bilateral agreements or protocols;

   Desiring the establishment of a multilateral framework of rules and disciplines to guide the development, adoption and enforcement of sanitary and phytosanitary measures in order to minimize their  negative effects on trade;

   Recognizing the important contribution that international standards, guidelines and recommendations can make in this regard;

   Desiring to further the use of harmonized sanitary and phytosanitary measures between Members, on the basis of international standards, guidelines and recommendations developed by the relevant international organizations, including the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the International Office of Epizootics, and the relevant international and regional organizations operating within the framework of the International Plant Protection Convention, without requiring Members to change their appropriate level of protection of human, animal or plant life or health;

   Recognizing that developing country Members may encounter special difficulties in complying with the sanitary or phytosanitary measures of importing Members, and as a consequence in access to markets, and also in the formulation and application of sanitary or phytosanitary measures in their own territories, and desiring to assist them in their endeavours in this regard;

Article 2: Basic Rights and Obligations

1.  Members have the right to take sanitary and phytosanitary measures necessary for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. 

2.  Members shall ensure that any sanitary or phytosanitary measure is applied only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, is based on scientific principles and is not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence, except as provided for in paragraph 7 of Article 5.

3.  Members shall ensure that their sanitary and phytosanitary measures do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between Members where identical or similar conditions prevail, including between their own territory and that of other Members.  Sanitary and phytosanitary measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on international trade.

4.  Sanitary or phytosanitary measures which conform to the relevant provisions of this Agreement shall be presumed to be in accordance with the obligations of the Members under the provisions of GATT 1994 which relate to the use of sanitary or phytosanitary measures, in particular the provisions of Article XX(b).
"
,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"Article 3: Harmonization

1.  To harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary measures on as wide a basis as possible, Members shall base their sanitary or phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where they exist, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, and in particular in paragraph 3.

2.  Sanitary or phytosanitary measures which conform to international standards, guidelines or recommendations shall be deemed to be necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, and presumed to be consistent with the relevant provisions of this Agreement and of GATT 1994.

3.  Members may introduce or maintain sanitary or phytosanitary measures which result in a higher level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection than would be achieved by measures based on the relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations, if there is a scientific justification, or as a consequence of the level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection a Member determines to be appropriate in accordance with the relevant provisions of paragraphs 1 through 8 of Article 5 (2)  Notwithstanding the above, all measures which result in a level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection different from that which would be achieved by measures based on international standards, guidelines or recommendations shall not be inconsistent with any other provision of this Agreement.

4.  Members shall play a full part, within the limits of their resources, in the relevant international organizations and their subsidiary bodies, in particular the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the International Office of Epizootics, and the international and regional organizations operating within the framework of the International Plant Protection Convention, to promote within these organizations the development and periodic review of standards, guidelines and recommendations with respect to all aspects of sanitary and phytosanitary measures.

5.  The Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures provided for in paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article 12 (referred to in this Agreement as the “Committee”) shall develop a procedure to monitor the process of international harmonization and coordinate efforts in this regard with the relevant international organizations."

1.  Members shall accept the sanitary or phytosanitary measures of other Members as equivalent, even if these measures differ from their own or from those used by other Members trading in the same product, if the exporting Member objectively demonstrates to the importing Member that its measures achieve the importing Member’s appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection.  For this purpose, reasonable access shall be given, upon request, to the importing Member for inspection, testing and other relevant procedures.

2.  Members shall, upon request, enter into consultations with the aim of achieving bilateral and multilateral agreements on recognition of the equivalence of specified sanitary or phytosanitary measures.

Article 5: Assessment of Risk and Determination of the Appropriate Level of Sanitary or Phytosanitary Protection

1.  Members shall ensure that their sanitary or phytosanitary measures are based on an assessment, as appropriate to the circumstances, of the risks to human, animal or plant life or health, taking into account risk assessment techniques developed by the relevant international organizations.

2.  In the assessment of risks, Members shall take into account available scientific evidence;  relevant processes and production methods;  relevant inspection, sampling and testing methods;  prevalence of specific diseases or pests; existence of pest- or disease-free areas; relevant ecological and environmental conditions; and quarantine or other treatment.

3.  In assessing the risk to animal or plant life or health and determining the measure to be applied for achieving the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection from such risk, Members shall take into account as relevant economic factors:  the potential damage in terms of loss of production or sales in the event of the entry, establishment or spread of a pest or disease;  the costs of control or eradication in the territory of the importing Member;  and the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative approaches to limiting risks.

4.  Members should, when determining the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection, take into account the objective of minimizing negative trade effects.

5.  With the objective of achieving consistency in the application of the concept of appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection against risks to human life or health, or to animal and plant life or health, each Member shall avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions in the levels it considers to be appropriate in different situations, if such distinctions result in discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.  Members shall cooperate in the Committee, in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article 12, to develop guidelines to further the practical implementation of this provision.  In developing the guidelines, the Committee shall take into account all relevant factors, including the exceptional character of human health risks to which people voluntarily expose themselves.

6.  Without prejudice to paragraph 2 of Article 3, when establishing or maintaining sanitary or phytosanitary measures to achieve the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection, Members shall ensure that such measures are not more trade-restrictive than required to achieve their appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection, taking into account technical and economic feasibility.(3)

7.  In cases where relevant scientific evidence is insufficient, a Member may provisionally adopt sanitary or phytosanitary measures on the basis of available pertinent information, including that from the relevant international organizations as well as from sanitary or phytosanitary measures applied by other Members.  In such circumstances, Members shall seek to obtain the additional information necessary for a more objective assessment of risk and review the sanitary or phytosanitary measure accordingly within a reasonable period of time.

8.  When a Member has reason to believe that a specific sanitary or phytosanitary measure introduced or maintained by another Member is constraining, or has the potential to constrain, its exports and the measure is not based on the relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations, or such standards, guidelines or recommendations do not exist, an explanation of the reasons for such sanitary or phytosanitary measure may be requested and shall be provided by the Member maintaining the measure."
,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"Article 6: Adaptation to Regional Conditions, Including Pest- or Disease-Free Areas and Areas of Low Pest or Disease Prevalence 

1.  Members shall ensure that their sanitary or phytosanitary measures are adapted to the sanitary or phytosanitary characteristics of the area — whether all of a country, part of a country, or all or parts of several countries — from which the product originated and to which the product is destined.  In assessing the sanitary or phytosanitary characteristics of a region, Members shall take into account, inter alia, the level of prevalence of specific diseases or pests, the existence of eradication or control programmes, and appropriate criteria or guidelines which may be developed by the relevant international organizations.

2.  Members shall, in particular, recognize the concepts of pest- or disease-free areas and areas of low pest or disease prevalence.  Determination of such areas shall be based on factors such as geography, ecosystems, epidemiological surveillance, and the effectiveness of sanitary or phytosanitary controls.

3.  Exporting Members claiming that areas within their territories are pest- or disease-free areas or areas of low pest or disease prevalence shall provide the necessary evidence thereof in order to objectively demonstrate to the importing Member that such areas are, and are likely to remain, pest- or disease-free areas or areas of low pest or disease prevalence, respectively.  For this purpose, reasonable access shall be given, upon request, to the importing Member for inspection, testing and other relevant procedures."

Article 9: Technical Assistance

1.  Members agree to facilitate the provision of technical assistance to other Members, especially developing country Members, either bilaterally or through the appropriate international organizations.  Such assistance may be, inter alia, in the areas of processing technologies, research and infrastructure, including in the establishment of national regulatory bodies, and may take the form of advice, credits, donations and grants, including for the purpose of seeking technical expertise, training and equipment to allow such countries to adjust to, and comply with, sanitary or phytosanitary measures necessary to achieve the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection in their export markets. 

2.  Where substantial investments are required in order for an exporting developing country Member to fulfil the sanitary or phytosanitary requirements of an importing Member, the latter shall consider providing such technical assistance as will permit the developing country Member to maintain and expand its market access opportunities for the product involved.

1.   Members, within 90 days of the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement, shall notify the Council for Trade in Goods of all TRIMs they are applying that are not in conformity with the provisions of this Agreement.  Such TRIMs of general or specific application shall be notified, along with their principal features(1).

2.   Each Member shall eliminate all TRIMs which are notified under paragraph 1 within two years of the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement in the case of a developed country Member, within five years in the case of a developing country Member, and within seven years in the case of a least-developed country Member.

3.   On request, the Council for Trade in Goods may extend the transition period for the elimination of TRIMs notified under paragraph 1 for a developing country Member, including a least-developed country Member, which demonstrates particular difficulties in implementing the provisions of this Agreement.  In considering such a request, the Council for Trade in Goods shall take into account the individual development, financial and trade needs of the Member in question.

4.   During the transition period, a Member shall not modify the terms of any TRIM which it notifies under paragraph 1 from those prevailing at the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement so as to increase the degree of inconsistency with the provisions of Article 2.  TRIMs introduced less than 180 days before the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement shall not benefit from the transitional arrangements provided in paragraph 2.

5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, a Member, in order not to disadvantage established enterprises which are subject to a TRIM notified under paragraph 1, may apply during the transition period the same TRIM to a new investment (i) where the products of such investment are like products to those of the established enterprises, and (ii ) where necessary to avoid distorting the conditions of competition between the new investment and the established enterprises.  Any TRIM so applied to a new investment shall be notified to the Council for Trade in Goods.  The terms of such a TRIM shall be equivalent in their competitive effect to those applicable to the established enterprises, and it shall be terminated at the same time.

Article 6: Transparency

1.   Members reaffirm, with respect to TRIMs, their commitment to obligations on transparency and notification in Article X of GATT 1994, in the undertaking on “Notification” contained in the Understanding Regarding Notification, Consultation, Dispute Settlement and Surveillance adopted on 28 November 1979 and in the Ministerial Decision on Notification Procedures adopted on 15 April 1994.

3.   Each Member shall accord sympathetic consideration to requests for information, and afford adequate opportunity for consultation, on any matter arising from this Agreement raised by another Member.  In conformity with Article X of GATT 1994 no Member is required to disclose information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.

,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"Members

    Recognizing the provisions of Articles XII and XVIII:B of GATT 1994 and of the Declaration on Trade Measures Taken for Balance-of-Payments Purposes adopted on 28 November 1979 (BISD 26S/205-209, referred to in this Understanding as the “1979 Declaration”) and in order to clarify such provisions (1);

    Hereby agree as follows:

Application of Measures

1.   Members confirm their commitment to announce publicly, as soon as possible, time-schedules for the removal of restrictive import measures taken for Balance-of-Payments purposes. It is understood that such time-schedules may be modified as appropriate to take into account changes in the Balance-of-Payments situation. Whenever a time-schedule is not publicly announced by a Member, that Member shall provide justification as to the reasons therefor.

2.   Members confirm their commitment to give preference to those measures which have the least disruptive effect on trade. Such measures (referred to in this Understanding as “price-based measures”) shall be understood to include import surcharges, import deposit requirements or other equivalent trade measures with an impact on the price of imported goods. It is understood that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article II, price-based measures taken for Balance-of-Payments purposes may be applied by a Member in excess of the duties inscribed in the Schedule of that Member. Furthermore, that Member shall indicate the amount by which the price-based measure exceeds the bound duty clearly and separately under the notification procedures of this Understanding.

3.   Members shall seek to avoid the imposition of new quantitative restrictions for Balance-of-Payments purposes unless, because of a critical Balance-of-Payments situation, price-based measures cannot arrest a sharp deterioration in the external payments position. In those cases in which a Member applies quantitative restrictions, it shall provide justification as to the reasons why price-based measures are not an adequate instrument to deal with the Balance-of-Payments situation. A Member maintaining quantitative restrictions shall indicate in successive consultations the progress made in significantly reducing the incidence and restrictive effect of such measures. It is understood that not more than one type of restrictive import measure taken for Balance-of-Payments purposes may be applied on the same product.

4.   Members confirm that restrictive import measures taken for Balance-of-Payments purposes may only be applied to control the general level of imports and may not exceed what is necessary to address the Balance-of-Payments situation. In order to minimize any incidental protective effects, a Member shall administer restrictions in a transparent manner. The authorities of the importing Member shall provide adequate justification as to the criteria used to determine which products are subject to restriction. As provided in paragraph 3 of Article XII and paragraph 10 of Article XVIII, Members may, in the case of certain essential products, exclude or limit the application of surcharges applied across the board or other measures applied for Balance-of-Payments purposes. The term “essential products” shall be understood to mean products which meet basic consumption needs or which contribute to the Member’s effort to improve its Balance-of-Payments situation, such as capital goods or inputs needed for production. In the administration of quantitative restrictions, a Member shall use discretionary licensing only when unavoidable and shall phase it out progressively. Appropriate justification shall be provided as to the criteria used to determine allowable import quantities or values.

Procedures for Balance-of-Payments Consultations

5.   The Committee on Balance-of-Payments Restrictions (referred to in this Understanding as the “Committee”) shall carry out consultations in order to review all restrictive import measures taken for Balance-of-Payments purposes. The membership of the Committee is open to all Members indicating their wish to serve on it. The Committee shall follow the procedures for consultations on Balance-of-Payments restrictions approved on 28 April 1970 (BISD 18S/48-53, referred to in this Understanding as “full consultation procedures”), subject to the provisions set out below.

6.   A Member applying new restrictions or raising the general level of its existing restrictions by a substantial intensification of the measures shall enter into consultations with the Committee within four months of the adoption of such measures. The Member adopting such measures may request that a consultation be held under paragraph 4(a) of Article XII or paragraph 12(a) of Article XVIII as appropriate. If no such request has been made, the Chairman of the Committee shall invite the Member to hold such a consultation. Factors that may be examined in the consultation would include, inter alia, the introduction of new types of restrictive measures for Balance-of-Payments purposes, or an increase in the level or product coverage of restrictions.

7.   All restrictions applied for Balance-of-Payments purposes shall be subject to periodic review in the Committee under paragraph 4(b) of Article XII or under paragraph 12(b) of Article XVIII, subject to the possibility of altering the periodicity of consultations in agreement with the consulting Member or pursuant to any specific review procedure that may be recommended by the General Council.

8.   Consultations may be held under the simplified procedures approved on 19 December 1972 (BISD 20S/47-49, referred to in this Understanding as “simplified consultation procedures”) in the case of least-developed country Members or in the case of developing country Members which are pursuing liberalization efforts in conformity with the schedule presented to the Committee in previous consultations. Simplified consultation procedures may also be used when the Trade Policy Review of a developing country Member is scheduled for the same calendar year as the date fixed for the consultations. In such cases the decision as to whether full consultation procedures should be used will be made on the basis of the factors enumerated in paragraph 8 of the 1979 Declaration. Except in the case of least-developed country Members, no more than two successive consultations may be held under simplified consultation procedures."
,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"Notification and Documentation

9.   A Member shall notify to the General Council the introduction of or any changes in the application of restrictive import measures taken for Balance-of-Payments purposes, as well as any modifications in time-schedules for the removal of such measures as announced under paragraph 1. Significant changes shall be notified to the General Council prior to or not later than 30 days after their announcement. On a yearly basis, each Member shall make available to the Secretariat a consolidated notification, including all changes in laws, regulations, policy statements or public notices, for examination by Members. Notifications shall include full information, as far as possible, at the tariff-line level, on the type of measures applied, the criteria used for their administration, product coverage and trade flows affected.

10.   At the request of any Member, notifications may be reviewed by the Committee. Such reviews would be limited to the clarification of specific issues raised by a notification or examination of whether a consultation under paragraph 4(a) of Article XII or paragraph 12(a) of Article XVIII is required. Members which have reasons to believe that a restrictive import measure applied by another Member was taken for Balance-of-Payments purposes may bring the matter to the attention of the Committee. The Chairman of the Committee shall request information on the measure and make it available to all Members. Without prejudice to the right of any member of the Committee to seek appropriate clarifications in the course of consultations, questions may be submitted in advance for consideration by the consulting Member.

11.   The consulting Member shall prepare a Basic Document for the consultations which, in addition to any other information considered to be relevant, should include: (a) an overview of the Balance-of-Payments situation and prospects, including a consideration of the internal and external factors having a bearing on the Balance-of-Payments situation and the domestic policy measures taken in order to restore equilibrium on a sound and lasting basis; (b) a full description of the restrictions applied for Balance-of-Payments purposes, their legal basis and steps taken to reduce incidental protective effects; (c) measures taken since the last consultation to liberalize import restrictions, in the light of the conclusions of the Committee; (d) a plan for the elimination and progressive relaxation of remaining restrictions. References may be made, when relevant, to the information provided in other notifications or reports made to the WTO. Under simplified consultation procedures, the consulting Member shall submit a written statement containing essential information on the elements covered by the Basic Document.

12.   The Secretariat shall, with a view to facilitating the consultations in the Committee, prepare a factual background paper dealing with the different aspects of the plan for consultations. In the case of developing country Members, the Secretariat document shall include relevant background and analytical material on the incidence of the external trading environment on the Balance-of-Payments situation and prospects of the consulting Member. The technical assistance services of the Secretariat shall, at the request of a developing country Member, assist in preparing the documentation for the consultations.

Conclusions of Balance-of-Payments Consultations

13.   The Committee shall report on its consultations to the General Council. When full consultation procedures have been used, the report should indicate the Committee’s conclusions on the different elements of the plan for consultations, as well as the facts and reasons on which they are based. The Committee shall endeavour to include in its conclusions proposals for recommendations aimed at promoting the implementation of Articles XII and XVIII:B, the 1979 Declaration and this Understanding. In those cases in which a time-schedule has been presented for the removal of restrictive measures taken for Balance-of-Payments purposes, the General Council may recommend that, in adhering to such a time-schedule, a Member shall be deemed to be in compliance with its GATT 1994 obligations. Whenever the General Council has made specific recommendations, the rights and obligations of Members shall be assessed in the light of such recommendations. In the absence of specific proposals for recommendations by the General Council, the Committee’s conclusions should record the different views expressed in the Committee. When simplified consultation procedures have been used, the report shall include a summary of the main elements discussed in the Committee and a decision on whether full consultation procedures are required."

(1) On 1 January 1999, the euro replaced the currency of each Member State participating in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union, among which Spain and France, pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998.
(2) Prior to this Agreement, the Principality of Andorra did not have an official currency, nor had it concluded a monetary agreement with any Member State or third country. Spanish and French banknotes and coins were used de facto in Andorra and were replaced by euro banknotes and coins as from 1 January 2002. The Principality of Andorra has also issued some collector coins denominated in diners.
(3) In accordance with the present Monetary Agreement, the euro shall be the official currency of the Principality of Andorra. The Principality of Andorra will thus have the right to issue euro coins and the obligation to grant legal tender status euro banknotes and coins issued by the Eurosystem and the Member States which have adopted the euro. The Principality of Andorra should ensure that European Union rules on banknotes and coins denominated in euros — including those related to the protection of the euro against counterfeiting — are applicable within its territory.
(4) The Principality of Andorra has a significant banking sector which operates in close connection with that of the euro area. Relevant EU banking and financial legislation, legislation concerning the prevention of money laundering, the prevention of fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment, and statistical reporting requirements should therefore be made progressively applicable to the Principality of Andorra with a view to ensuring a more level playing field.

,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"Words are the essential tools of the law. In the study of law, language has great importance; cases turn on the meaning that judges ascribe to words, and lawyers must use the right words to effectuate the wishes of their clients. It has been said that you will be learning a new language when you study law, but it’s actually a bit more complicated. There are at least four ways in which you encounter the vocabulary of law.

First, and most obvious, you will be learning new words that you probably have not encountered before. These words and phrases have meaning only as legal terms. Words or phrases such as res judicata, impleader, executory interest, demurrer and mens rea,oblige students to acquire some new vocabulary. Learning the meaning of these words is essential to understand any case or discussion which uses them.

Second, and a bit more difficult, some recognizable words take on different or new meanings when used in the law. Malice, for example, when used in the law of defamation, does not mean hatred or meanness; it means “with reckless disregard for the truth.” Similarly, “consideration” in contract law, has nothing to do with thoughtfulness; it means something of value given by a party to an agreement. When a party is “prejudiced” in the law it usually means that the party was put at some disadvantage, not that the party is bigoted. “Fixtures” in property law are much more than bathroom and kitchen equipment. There are many words like this in the law, and students must shake loose their ordinary understanding of a word to absorb its legal meaning. Words that have distinct or specialized meanings in the law are sometimes called “terms of art.”

Third, there are words whose meaning expands, contracts or changes, depending on the context or the place in which it is used. In one context (divorce, for example), a person may be considered a “resident” of a state if she has lived there for 6 months. In another context (getting a driver’s license) a person may be considered a “resident” after just a few days. In one state, a person may be said to “possess” a firearm if it is within his/her reach in an auto. In another state, that person might have to be in control of the firearm to be considered in possession of it. Thus, the same word can have a different meaning depending on what question is being asked, and where it is being asked.

Fourth, there are words that have come to signify large bodies of law or legal doctrine, and act as shorthand terms for complex concepts. The terms “unfair competition,” “due process of law,” “foreseeable,” and “cruel and unusual punishment” are a few examples. These terms have been subject to interpretation by judges in many cases over long periods of time, and there is little hope of finding a clear and concise definition that can serve in all contexts.

Finally, students need to develop a heightened respect for linguistic precision. Because the meaning of words is so crucial to the craft of lawyering, students will be expected to use words carefully and precisely. You will learn, for example, that there are legally significant differences between “Sally lives in the United States,” “Sally resides in the United States,” “Sally is domiciled in the United States,” and “Sally is a citizen of the United States.” Even grammar and punctuation can be crucial: a person who leaves $50,000 “to each of my children who took care of me,” has a different intention than a person who leaves $50,000 “to each of my children, who took care of me.” The lawyer drafting the will needs to know how to wield that comma, or better yet, how to avoid any confusion in the first place.

Once you have learned the legal meanings of words, you are expected to use them with precision. Substituting one for another can result in serious errors and misunderstandings. The legal meanings of words constitute the common language of lawyers and judges, who rely on this language to communicate efficiently and effectively."

demurrer (dee-muhr-ur): A formal response to a complaint filed in a lawsuit, pleading for dismissal and saying, in effect, that even if the facts are true, there is no legal basis for a lawsuit. Examples include a missing necessary element of fact, or a complaint that is unclear. The judge can agree and “leave to amend,” giving the claimant the opportunity to amend the complaint.

A misdemeanor is more serious than an infraction but less serious than a felony. Common examples of misdemeanors are DUI, shoplifting and domestic violence that does not result in a serious injury.

California misdemeanors fall into two basic categories:

“Standard” California misdemeanors, punishable by up to 6 months in jail and/or a fine of up to $1,000; and
“Gross” or “aggravated” misdemeanors,” punishable by up to 364 days in jail and/or a fine of up to $1,000 or more.1
There are also certain crimes known as California “wobbler” offenses. These are crimes which the prosecutor can choose to charge as a misdemeanor or a felony (or, in some cases, a misdemeanor or an infraction).

,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"1. What is the penalty for a misdemeanor in California?

California misdemeanors fall into two general categories:

Standard misdemeanors, and
“Gross” or “aggravated” misdemeanors.
Note that in Los Angeles County, courts must impose sentences on the low end of the penalty range absent extraordinary circumstances.2

1.1. Punishment for a standard misdemeanor

Standard California misdemeanors are offenses that are usually punishable by a maximum of:

6 months in county jail, and /or
A fine of up to $1,000.
1.2. Punishment for a “gross” or “aggravated” misdemeanor

Certain California misdemeanor offenses are considered more serious than others. These are known as “gross misdemeanors” or “aggravated misdemeanors.”

In California, consequences of a gross misdemeanor conviction can include:

Up to 364 days in county jail, and/or
A fine of up to $1,000 or more.
You may sometimes read that a misdemeanor can be punished by “up to 1 year” in the county jail.

But as of January 1, 2015, the maximum sentence for a California misdemeanor is 364 days.3 As discussed in Section 7, below, this prevents a misdemeanor crime involving moral turpitude from being a “deportable offense” under U.S. law.

In this article, we use the terms “up to 364 days” and “up to 1 year” interchangeably."
,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"2. What are some common misdemeanors in California?

Common standard misdemeanors include (but are not limited to):

Drug possession — California Health and Safety Code 11350 HS,
Drunk in public — Penal Code 647(f) PC,
Indecent Exposure (1st offense) — Penal Code 314 PC,
Petty theft — Penal Code 484,
Prostitution — Penal Code 647(b),
Shoplifting — Penal Code 459.5 PC, and
Trespassing (some charges)– Penal Code 602 PC.
Common “aggravated” misdemeanors include (but are not limited to):

Domestic battery — Penal Code 243(e)(1),
Driving on a suspended license — Vehicle Code 14601 VC,
DUI without injury — Vehicle Code 23152(a) and(b), and
Violating a restraining order — Penal Code 273.6 PC."

Some California offenses can be charged either more or less seriously, in the prosecutor’s discretion.

These so-called California “wobbler” offenses fall into two categories:

Misdemeanor / felony wobblers, and
Misdemeanor / infraction wobblers.
How the prosecutor chooses to charge a wobbler offense depends on:

The facts of the case, and/or
The defendant’s criminal history, if any.4
3.1. What are some common misdemeanor / felony wobblers?

Common misdemeanor / felony “wobbler” crimes in California include (but are not limited to):

Brandishing a weapon — Penal Code 417 (punishable as a misdemeanor by up to 1 year jail sentence and/or up to a $1,000 fine),
Elder abuse — Penal Code 368 (punishable as a misdemeanor by up to 1 year in jail and/or up to a $6,000 fine), and
Assault with a deadly weapon — Penal Code 245(a)(1) (punishable as a misdemeanor by up to 1 year in jail and/or up to a $10,000 fine).
3.2. What are some common misdemeanor / infraction wobblers?

Examples of California misdemeanor / infraction wobblers include (but are not limited to):

Disturbing the peace — Penal Code 415 (punishable as a misdemeanor by up to 90 days in jail and/or up to a $400 fine), and
Wobbler trespassing (punishable as a misdemeanor by up to 6 months in jail and/or up to a $1,000 fine)."
,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"A case can be dropped at any stage if the evidence is weak or the court grants a motion to suppress evidence
4. What is the process after a misdemeanor arrest?

Misdemeanor cases in California can proceed through various stages in the following order:

Arrest;
Arraignment (formal charging and plea);
Bail hearing;
Pretrial phase (including discovery and motions to dismiss or exclude evidence);
Jury trial or bench trial; and
Appeal.
Most misdemeanor cases will not go through all of these steps. A case can be dropped at any stage if the evidence is weak or the court grants a motion to suppress evidence. Or the prosecution and the defense can agree to a plea bargain in California.

For more information about each of these stages, please see our article on “California’s Criminal Court Process.”"
,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"5. Can I get probation for a misdemeanor?

Misdemeanor violations are often punished with misdemeanor probation in California. Misdemeanor probation is sometimes referred to as “summary,” or “informal” probation.

Misdemeanor probation typically lasts for 1 year unless the crime statute specifies otherwise. During that time, the defendant must adhere to certain conditions in order to stay out of jail.

Conditions of probation can include (without limitation):

Community service or labor (such as CAL-TRANS roadside work),
Electronic monitoring or house arrest,
Participation in counseling / treatment programs, and /or
Paying victim restitution.
Having an experienced California criminal lawyer on your side can greatly improve your chances of receiving probation instead of jail time.

Note that in Los Angeles County, courts must grant probation in probation-eligible cases absent extraordinary circumstances."
,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"6. Does a misdemeanor give you a criminal record?

A misdemeanor charge results in a criminal record when:

The defendant pleads guilty;
The defendant pleads “no contest”; or
The defendant is found guilty at trial.
An exception is when defendants participate in and successfully complete California PC 1000 Drug Diversion or Prop 36 drug diversion.

If the defendant successfully completes diversion, the judge will dismiss the charges and there will be no conviction.

Otherwise, a conviction stays on the defendant’s criminal record unless and until it is sealed or expunged."
,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"7. Can you expunge a misdemeanor from your record in California?

California law permits expungement of most misdemeanor crimes
California law permits expungement of most misdemeanor crimes. The exception is a misdemeanor sex crime against a child – such as certain counts of statutory rape, California Penal Code 261.5 PC.

To be eligible to expunge a California misdemeanor the defendant:

Must have successfully completed probation, and
Must not currently be charged with, on probation for, or serving a sentence for a criminal offense.
If asked about criminal history on a job application or in an interview, the defendant does not need to disclose an expunged conviction.

,,,,,technical and legal,,,,,,,,,"8. Can a misdemeanor conviction lead to deportation?

Most misdemeanors do not lead to deportation unless they involve:

Drugs,
Firearms, or
Domestic violence.
Under U.S. law, non-citizens are subject to deportation if within five years of admission to the U.S they commit a crime that:

Involves “moral turpitude,” and
