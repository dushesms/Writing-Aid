"Dear Mayor,
I would like to request to name the new activity center after the famous baseball player - Roberto Clemente.
During his carrer he has not only been succesful in sport, but succesful in fond raising. Roberto has planned sport centers in Puerto Rico and California. He has delivered supplies to earthquake victims. He promotes antiracism.
Apart from his charity work, he has been a good person in general. He has always been teaching the kids value of hard work by showing his own example. He grew up poor, coud not even afford basic equipment. Yet still, became a pro playerat 18.
I suppose that those attributes would do good for the reputation of the new activity center. Please do consider my offer. I will be wating for any kind of respond.

"Dear Mr King, 

In our city here is the new community activity center. I think, it should be named for Roberto Clemente. 

Roberto Clemente is the most successful baseball player. He was born in Puerto Rico. In childhood he grew up poor, so there was no money to buy the sport equipment, but with his passion and courage he became a talented baseball athlete. With time, he became a Puerto Rican proffesional league baseball player at age 18. When he was 20 years old, he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers Major League Baseball team. 

First, I think we can demonstrate the biography of Roberto Clemente and show why he is a successful person though making a museum for him. Secondly, we can open the baseball lessons for children. Roberto did it at his time, so we can show our respect to him through this changing. Thirdly, we can donate money for charity from the museum and lessons because he also did this and the donation was a part of his life. 

The center can have Roberto Clemente as a symbol to demonstrate the success, power and hard work to reach the sport goals.

Subject: Why the new activity center should be named for Roberto Clemente. 

Dear, Mayor

It should be named by Roberto Clemente because he made a lot of things to help poor people to access education and athletics, he played in Pittsburg Pirates team, he impressed everyone with his running speed, he also won a gold medal. 
When he was helping to poor people he planned to open sport center for children in Puerto Rico and California.

My name is Stasy and in this letter I want to give you some points and advices why the new activity center should be named for Roberto Clemente. 

First of all, I think you should do that because Roberto Clemente is very beautiful baceball player and your center'll become very popular because of his name. 

Second of all, Roberto is a good person too and I think he will be very pleased to you and maybe sometime he'll come on some lessons and even share, explain or do something for the students. So if that'll happen, you'll be popular, like I said it already. 

And the third, if you'll do that and become popular, you'll have more permisions. You'll have some interesting trips, competitions and maybe Roberto will travel with you, and because of that, you'll have more chance to win in competitions because Roberto will explain you how to win and what you can do for winning. 

So, I think that's all main points that I wanted you tell you. I hope you'll think about my idea and take the right decision.

Roberto Clemente is a famous baseball player, he spent a lot of time by training. In my opinion his achievements and contributions are important because He is a very good example of such great person. For example: he grew up poor and could not afford sports equipment, despite this he became famous in sports. Another thing is that he became a professional league baseball player age 18, he was too young. Next, is that he acted as a role model for children what is worthly of respect. Based on what we said we can justifiably say, that the activity center should be named for Roberto Clemente for his services to sport and high achievements.

"Hello, my name is Simon murashev, and I want to tell you about valontiring activitys with first graders.

1) You shouldn't go outside into the snow, rain etc.
2) You will be like a teacher , and you will get many respect.
3) It is easy to work there, but it is matters realy much. 

Also it is not durty work, so you don't need to wear some ""uniform"".

Valontearing- is a good activity, and if it is easy and good for you - it will be great!

  I think that task to visit the nearby elementary school to tutor first graders is helpful just if you want to be a teacher.

  But there is one reason to go to the second activity - you will be better in comunication, specialy if they are children.But it is just one lesson and there is one reason to go to second task.

  So in my opinion it will be better to go to first activity because of  four reasons. ",2.7

Or if the other people will see it maybe they also will do it because all peaple are repiting by each others maybe they will understand that it is the very big problem in the world.
The third reason why my choice is to clean up the park because. You can do it with your friends so it is will be interesting.
Maybe you will like it and after school you will do it for your own.

 
That is why my choice was to clean up the nature.",2.7

I think, that students shuld do ''Clening Up a Park'' activity.

The first reason of that, in my opinion, is that nature need our help! Many people throwing thrush just in forests and parks. We need to stop that also.

The second reason, is that also there are less and less trees, and we can grow smal trees in our houses and then put them in the park.

The third reason is that small kids or dogs can take something from the ground and eat, butthat will be bad for them.

That is why I think that students shuld do cleaning up a park activity.

"There are many volunteering ideas such as cleaning around school building and help school members. In my opinion, I think being a library helper can be a nice volunteer idea.
 Library is a place that most of the students go and stay during the school time. Because of it School-Library gets messy and the books are not in its place easily. That's the main reason that students can help school librarion or the adults.
 Did you see students running and shouting in library even their teachers teach and beg to be quiet? I saw them being like that. There should be volunteering students to make library more better and convinient place. Library is a place that educates people. And to make educating society, I think there should be some helpers.
 We can make library better or just nicer. Volunteering activities can make volunteers improve and the volunteered place or people improve. Books can give a person hope and give any feeling.

On hat day students bring their hats and just play with them because it could be fun. Because twin day is wearing the same clothes, but students wear same uniformevery day and its borring and uncomfortable.On a hat day students can bring any hats that they want, they are feeling special because they are not like others.

"Mohandas Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in India. He lived in India his childhood then moved to South Africa. Experienced severe racism South Africa just like his country. He worked for 20 years for the right of his country and also for the rights of South Africa. Gandhi went to law school in Britain. There he went to jail multiple times for his social activism in India. He empowered people to organize non- violently and he also worked hard to unite muslim and Hindu communities in India. Gandhi returned to India in 1915 were people named him Mahatma that means ""great soul"". In 1947 India got their freedom thanks to Gandhi and a year later Gandhi died in January 30, 1948.",2
"""The Force of Love by peace always wins over violence"": this quote is a Reflection of what Mohandas Ganghi was. 
Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in India, where he spent the first years of his life. Then he completed Law School in prestigious university in Britain. It was very rare for an Indian to have such an education and status. 
Gandhi then moved to South Africa, one of Britain's colonies. It experienced humiliation because of his skin color and nationality, but he didnot take this, he fought the hardest way ever known; Gandhi fought with peace and non-violent disobedience, worked for 20 years for the rights of Indians and opposed discriminatory laws against African people during the early 1900's. 
In 1915, he returned to India to continue what he had already started in South Africa. However, the English knew about him and they put him in jail because of his Social Activism. When he got out of prison he continued his restless campaign against the English government. 
His belief of Satyagraha (peaceful disobedience) seemed like a waste of lives and time for most of  belligerant and savage war towards independence with few followers Mohandas Gandhi led non-violent assemblies against oppressive Laws and with the help of time he gained more and more followers and unified the two major religions of India with a same goal: Independence from the English regiment.
After many years of civilian disobedience, India earned independence from britain in 1947 and Gandhi was given the title Mahatma (great soul) in Sansrkit. Although he had already accomplished his major cause, Mohandas Gandhi was not done yet; he worked hard to unite Muslim and Hindu communities in India until the day of his death on January 20, 1948. In present days, his actions are specialy remembered on ""Non-violence Day"" sponsored by United NAtions, and ""Gandhi Day"" celebrated in India. 
Mahatma Gandhi will always be remembered as a single person that unified and led millions of people through the path of Love by peace. ",5
Some students want to go to a planetarium to learn more about our solar system. Bowen sunopuermop mompt cot youepowgecm Boyeacilloy,1
I was thinking About the field trip I think we should go to the рands and Science museum Because you can Build thing and lean. How to make them you can see How things work in the sience world also to participate in interactive activities with/ others. thank you for your еime and reading this.,2
"The best field trip is nature center. 
First Reason is in the nature center I could learn about a lots of animals. What kind of animals like snakes tigers, lions, and lots of wild animals. 
The second reason is what couls I lear about those animals if they are poison what kind of food they like if they are scare of humans. how much they eat a day. Like for example What kind of food those the snake like. I should learn that in the nature center hear about how many kind of animals live in the wild to stay away from what animals all those kind of things I could learn in the nature center. 
The third reason is are wild animals dangerю I could learn that too in the nature center. Are wild animals dange? Not all of theт are. all those kind of things I could learn in the nature center. 
In conclusion nature center was the best field trip caose. I learn all kind of animals. What they eat and what is these behaviour in the woild. If there danger of not cause in the wild thei are danger animals. You never know wen ther going to comeout so becareful.",3
"There are so many тeat places to go to but the best one is nature center. There is a lot of reasons why lets уxamin some of them.
The first reason is because you can learn lots of neat stuff. For example, you can learn the names of different trees plant ect. You can enjoy some fresh air. 
The second reason is because you can see and lean what they like to do all the time. what they like to eat probably even feed them.
The Third reason you can meet their -habatates and see there wayes : of life see what kide of place it is. A humid place of a rainy place of even a dry place. 
As you can see nature center is a good place to go you cansee neat animales and learn a lot about them and what they like to do and what kind of place they live in. ",4
"Don't you wonder how all the planets in the universe were made? There are so many unbelievable things that people can hardly imagine. I recommend to go to a planetarium. Some students might get a new dream through this trip. Especially, a сardinal probem in the whole world is global warming. Also, protecting people from disasters from the outer space is important as much as protectiong people from disasters that happen in the earth. 
You have a dream, don't you? I have one too. Some students or kids don't have one. It doesn't mean they don't want to have a dream, but means they did not ever have a chance to develope and improve their talents and skills. They might find their talents about the solar system. They might get a new dream. Giving dreams and hopes to students is a job of teachers, isn't it? 
Scientists are looking for a planet inhere people should live later because they think there is a possibility for people to leave the earth. In fact, almost all people are using fossil fuels such as coal of oil everyday. If the phase continues, the earth may face downfall. Before this happens, we have to find we have to find one. Students help the scientists too. They really should know how grave the problem is. 
There are so many disasters such as earthquakes or tsunamis that happen in the earth. Have you noticed that there are also disasters in the univers? Huge stones and ores are steppong to the earth. If they literally crush the earth, the earth would be like a handkerchief. I hope students consider aboutthis. 
There is a book named ""The New Solar System"" which is written by andrew Chaikin, and it really shows well about the solar system. Maybe, you could hand out some copies of the book to students before the trip. Therefore, I recommend you to let students go to a planetarium. I hope you understand my thought and opinions. ",5
"Nature and science have a lot in relation. You can learn about how the living organisms work and what you can do to care for them. You can also learn how things work and how they are good for the world and our benefits. I think going to a nature center is the best place to go if you want to learn more about science and the world. 
One reason that it is better going to a nature center is because you can learn about the world. That is what science is about. It is about feeling, knowing, and exploring the world and your curiosities. At a nature center, you can learn what lives around you and even all over the world. Also you can learn how to care for the wonders in nature and how to keep them alive. 
The second reason that it is better to go to a nature center is because you can talk about experiences not any average person would have. Most of our loves have been consumed by living in the city of urban places. It is very difficult to see nature there. That is why if you go to a nature center, you could see things you have never seen before. You might be able to see an exotic plant or animal and observe its behavior.
Lastly, you wont imagine how much you will be learning. You will have so much fun that you wont even realize that you are learning. Sharing this knowledge.get you real exited and give you a wanting to learn more about nature. Also all of the things you saw were alive and not models your imagination go wild after seeing a real life living organisms. 
All of these reasons leads to why I think you should go to a nature center. Basicly, its all for the fun of not only knowing about science, but also aboit the worls and the knowing of things you didnt even know existed. Once you realized that you had fun learning, you might want to go back or even do research for yourself. It's fun to discover new things on your own!

"If I was to pick which was the best field trip choice, it would be the nature center. I decided that choice because to me there is more to life than cities and suburbs. It's best to learn how would you survive in nature and its mishappens. Also, it's best to see what beautiful things are stored in nature. More so many people love to enjoy nature. 
It is best to experience life outside of your home. In life it best to experience new things. Nature is one of those new things. Nature have many things that you probably didn't know about. It is best to experience them. 
Nature was here before human beings, so it's good to see what they had to deal with. Human beings before our time didn't have buildings or electronics. They had nature and they used it to survive. People should learn survival skills incase they get into an situation where they need to use them. The Nature Center is the best place to go learn those skills. 
Many things fascinate the human kind why not nature. In nature there are many fascinating things. There are many animals that you probably never seen. It would be best to learn about plants in nature. You can even ask for how long they've been on Earth. 
The Nature Center is the best place to go for a field trip. Mostly because of the new experiences. Learning new survival skills and how humans survived. Also learning about the plants and animals in nature. That is why it's best to go to a nature center for a field trip. ",5.5
"Many students don't know anything about life yet. If middle schoolers went out into the world at a young age, the couldn't survive. Some wouldn't even know where to start. Thats why a field trip to the neture center would be most proper.
The nature center is an outdoors trip. Students can experience a little fun outdoors, but at the same time learn something new. Animals struggle through life just like humans do. On the trip students can learn how to survive by observing how the animals cope with struggles. When a bird is born, the parents make the baby leave at only two weeks old. When students see this happening, it will open eyes everywhere. Then realizing that growing up is just around the corner, and that it isn't too far away. 
Another reason to go would be because students get a chance to learn about the plants and foot tracks of animals. The teacher would be showing the young ladies and gentlemen what poison ivy looks like. Students can also learn many interesting facts about the flowers and trees around the nature center. Along the way tracks of some sort od animal might appear... this gives the children a chance to learn about the kind of foot an animal ma. In the process the pupils are learning about the animal as well. Also the children would even learn which animals' feet are similar to a human beings. 
Lastly the pupils would learn about the environment, and weather. How the weather affects the environment an animal lives in... would be one thing the children learn. Students would also learn how the animals mate, and how trees change color during different seasons. Throughout the whole lesson, the student might become intriged by the surroundings. Many might ask how everything got to where it is today. The students might learn a thing or two. 
All in all this would be a life experience for the students. As well as fun and adventurous. Since in the whole trip the children might have learned about life, growing up, and the environment. It would be an educational and outdoors trip. It would give students a chance to get away from sunschool. Although they would learn a lot; they would also have some fun. All of the reasons I listed are why I want the class to go to the nature center on the next field trip. It would give everyone a chance to have an exciting day while learning something new. ",5.8

So don't take the easy way.",2
I am most likely than the horse because I do whay I am told to do. I don't listen to guys who won't do it and do something else. Its omportant to get your work done. It is sometimes hard to do. It is sometimes fun to do. It takes time. You don't rush to get it done.,3
"I think I'm more like the horse because I don't do wrong things on purpose like the donkey. I try to do the right things, so I won't have lots of homework or something else kind of like how the donkey had a lot of work. Instead of trying to get out of my work. Instead of trying to get out of my work or homework and making an excuse. I just do my work it's better that way.",4
"To me I'm more like the horse because I do my job at home. When me and my mom go to the grocery store I help her with the bags. My brother gets the big ones and I get the rest then my sister puts the things away. I like helping so things are done fast and we don't have more work, like donkey. It's good to help because then you don't waste things like donkey did with the sugar. and the horse is right because you shouldn't be trying to get away from doing work and if you try you may get away with it but you may have more work too. So this are all the reasons why I think I'm more like a horse because helping is a good thing. ",5
In real life I'm more like horse. One example is I never ever cheat. In karate they master I made the whole class do pushups. Some people weren't doing them when he wasn't looking but I did them. My second example is I never lie. When I was at camp me and a boy got in trouble. He said he didn't hit me but I hit him. I said we didn't even hit each other. Later they found out that we didn't hit eachother and the boy got in trouble for lieing to a teacher. The last example is I never ever listen to bad things. Once my friend told me to take a match and light it. I said it was to dangerous and risky. So later I ended up not lighting it. I told my parents I didn't listen to him. Me and the horse are alike because we are both good and don't do bad things. Also me and the horse both hate doing wrong things. ,6

"Today I'm writting about If I'm a Donkey or a Horse.

Second, when we go to buy groceries I always carry the bags of food I never fall or say ""I'm tired"". If I'm said ""I'm tired"" they wouldn't pay me 5 dollars an hour. 
Third, I always say to my brother never to give up when we are carrying something because you can get something.
In conclusion I think Im a horse rather then a donkey because I never do things to stop doing what im doing.",5
"I am like a horse because I try to do and get on everything right. I try not to be lazy and I try not to do bad things like the donkey, because if I do bad things on purpose, I would have to work even harder than the others. This would not be a good thing. If I were a donkey, I would be  embarrassed that I have to work harder. But, I would get what I did. Kind of like a punishment. Good thing I'm not a donkey. I can give you three examples why I'm a horse. I work hard, and I get what I earned. Two, I don't do bad things on porpuse. And number three, I like to get things done by doing it fair. Not by dropping it and say I'm done. If you or me, do things like the donkey, we would feel really sad and sorry for myself. And so would you. ",4.8

"If I could have to chose wich character from the story I am, I would say I'm more like the horse. I usually do my job, but no one is perfect. Sometimes I'm also disobeying. for example when I sometimes used to clean my room and I don't want to O mak it easier and put my stuff underneath my bed.

I am more like the horse. I think that becaus my teacher always says that I work too much. The horse worked harder the first time and I usually work really hard.

The horse did the hard work first and so it was easier for him the next time he had to work. The horse is smarter than the donkey.

"I think I'm very alike to the horse. I work very hard to get a job done not just act lazy. I help my parents alot, for example I go to work with them. If someone does something I know is not good I don't copy them. I just ignore it and maybe talk about it with my parents. I believe everyone should have jobs not just be lazy and pretend you're doing something. If someone like one of my friends don't do something right or do something wrong I explain to them just so it won't happen again.
